Dear Dror,

I thank you for your email and I am happy with the plan to try to publish
the work first with "Science", than "PNAS" and than with "PLOS ONE". It
sounds clear to me now and I think we can see a final date for the initial
submission now.
Jan will be back this Wednesday, so I will meet him later this week as well
to discuss the last charts I created and to find out more about his
feelings and opinion about the draft.

We can talk after your conference via Skype. Best day for me would be
Tuesday, 26th of August, 10 am (your time in Boston). Would this work also
for you?

Now I go back to some more offline work, we prepare our new flat for the
move this week. After the move I have a bigger office and more space for
some more Hadoop-cluster nodes ;-)

Have a nice day and see you soon.

Best wishes
Mirko
