Abstract. We study the duration of “high-ﬂow states” in freeway traﬃc, deﬁned as the time periods for
which traﬃc ﬂows exceed a given ﬂow threshold. Our empirical data are surprisingly well represented by
a power law. Moreover, the power law exponent for a two-lane freeway seems to be independent of the
chosen ﬂow threshold. In order to interpret this discovery, we investigate a simple theoretical model of
heterogeneous traﬃc with overtaking maneuvers, which is able to reproduce both, the empirical power law
and its exponent.

1 Introduction

Eﬃcient transport systems are needed to fulﬁl the re-
quirements of industrialized societies. However, studies of
traﬃc physicists have shown that the capacity of a free-
way is reduced by the breakdown of traﬃc ﬂows [1–4], a
phenomenon which is widely known as “capacity drop”.
Moreover, when the vehicle density increases, the traﬃc
ﬂow becomes metastable, i.e. a breakdown of traﬃc ﬂow
can be triggered by perturbations, if they exceed a critical
perturbation threshold [1,3,5,6]. At even higher densities,
traﬃc ﬂow becomes linearly unstable, and a breakdown
may be triggered by the slightest perturbation [3,7].

Due to the dependence of traﬃc breakdowns on per-
turbations of the traﬃc ﬂow, it is essential to know the
characteristic properties of vehicle ﬂows. While much at-
tention has been paid to the measurement and explanation
of the wide scattering of vehicle ﬂows after the breakdown
of free traﬃc (see e.g. Refs. [8–11] and citations therein),
the features of ﬂows before the breakdown have not found
the attention they deserve. For example, the time pe-
riod immediately before the breakdown is characterized
by “high-ﬂow states” [12–15] (see Fig. 1). These high-ﬂow
states are produced by small time gaps between subse-
quent vehicles, i.e. by vehicle clusters. Before we study
these states, let us therefore shortly discuss some previ-
ous literature on vehicle platoons (see Ref. [3]).

The formation of platoons is typically a result of the
fact that vehicles do not behave identically. Driver-vehicle
behavior is rather heterogeneous, which is typically re-
ﬂected by ﬂuctuation terms and distributed model pa-
rameters. The simplest models of stochastic and het-
erogeneous transport are particle hopping models with
quenched disorder. For example, Evans [17], Krug and
Ferrari [18], Karimipour [19,20], as well as Seppa¨la¨inen
and Krug [21] study a simpliﬁed version of a model
by Benjamini et al. [22]. It corresponds to the one-
dimensional driven lattice gas known as TASEP, but with
particle-speciﬁc, constant jump rates qα. If overtaking is
not allowed, Krug and Ferrari [18] ﬁnd a sharp phase tran-
sition between a low-density regime, where all particles are
queueing behind the slowest particle, and a high-density
regime, where the particles are equally distributed. Note
that the slow particles “feel free traﬃc” until the critical
density is reached, at which traﬃc ﬂow becomes unstable
(cf. the truck curve in Fig. 2).

Close to the critical density, where the traﬃc ﬂow be-
comes unstable, the growth of vehicle platoons is charac-
terized by a power-law coarsening. If particles move bal-
listically with individual velocities vα and form a platoon
when a faster particle reaches a slower one, the platoon
size npl(t) grows according to

npl(t) ∼ t(δ+1)/(δ+2), (1)
where the exponent δ characterizes the distribution
P0(v) ∼ (v − vmin)δ of free velocities in the neighborhood

of the minimal desired velocity vmin [24–30]. Beyond it,
the diﬀerences among fast and slow particles become ir-
relevant, because there is so little space that all particles
have to move slower than preferred.

Platoon formation and power-law coarsening
has also been found in microscopic models with
parallel update [24–27,29–32]. An example is the
Nagel-Schreckenberg model with vehicle-speciﬁc slow-
down probabilities [33,34].

An empirical measurement of platoon sizes has
been performed by Neubert et al., based on velocity
correlations between subsequent cars [35]. Our own ap-
proach will rather be focused on time periods with small
time gaps between vehicles. For a model for platoon size
distributions see Islam and Consul [36]. Furthermore, we
point to the nice analyses of vehicle clustering based on
master and Fokker-Planck equations [37–39], and to the
determination of gap distributions for free traﬃc with ve-
hicle platoons [40].

In the following, we will relate the distribution of pla-
toon sizes with their growth dynamics, and study the
importance of overtaking maneuvers for both. Before we
start our theoretical considerations, however, Section 2
will present data of “high-ﬂow states” and discuss their
unexpected power-law statistics. Afterwards, Section 3
will present a theoretical explanation, based on platoon

1 For reasons of illustration, the ﬁgure displays ﬁve-minute
averages, so that the curves belonging to diﬀerent cross sec-
tions of the freeway can be well enough resolved. (Two-minute
data would show a larger variability. The variability is expected
to be inversely proportional to the square root of the number
of vehicles averaged over, i.e. to the square root of the sam-
pling time.) For the analysis of the high-ﬂow states, the sam-
pling time should be chosen large enough to smoothen over
statistical variations of the ﬂow, but small enough to keep sys-
tematic features of the traﬃc dynamics. Two-minute averages,
which are analyzed in the following, have been determined as
an ideal compromise [41]. They also provide a suﬃcient number
of data points for the analysis of high-ﬂow states.

formation due to overtaking maneuvers by slow vehicles,
speciﬁcally trucks. This does, of course, not exclude the
theoretical possibility of other explanations, e.g. based on
the vehicle dynamics in single lanes. This alternative ap-
proach is discussed in Section 3.1. A summary of this pa-
per is ﬁnally presented in Section 4.

2 Power law distribution of high-ﬂow states

As high ﬂows are unstable to medium-sized perturba-
tions [3,5], it is important to learn more about their statis-
tics. Here, we deﬁne “high-ﬂow states” by exceeding a
given ﬂow threshold Qthr (which may be chosen much
smaller than the maximum ﬂow Qmax or the dynamic
capacity Qout, i.e. the outﬂow from seriously congested
traﬃc)2.

In the following, we study the duration of “high ﬂow
states” by analyzing single-vehicle data of the Dutch free-
way A9 from Haarlem to Amsterdam in the Netherlands
(see Refs. [9,16,41] for details of the data). Speciﬁcally, we
aggregated the data to obtain 2-min averages Q(x, t) of
the ﬂow as a function of time t at a certain location x
of the freeway. Afterwards, we determined the frequency
of time periods ΔT over which the ﬂows Q(x, t) stayed
above a certain threshold Qthr (see Fig. 3). A representa-
tive example is shown in Figure 4.

Similar pictures as for Qthr = 1400 vehicles/h are
found for other threshold values Qthr, but the data tend
to be more noisy for large values of Qthr, as the typical
durations of high-ﬂow states become shorter. Generally,

2 Qout is typically of the order of 1800 vehicles per kilometer
and lane. In contrast, Qmax in the left (fast) lane reaches values
upto Qmax = 3200 vehicles per hour. In the right (truck) lane,
the maximum ﬂow does not exceed values of 2500 vehicles per
hour. These values are for averages over 50 vehicles [16]. For
further details about the studied data see references [9,16].

this time period. These time periods are indicated by solid
horizontal lines, while a dotted line was used if Q(x, t) < Qthr.

averages of single vehicle data of the Dutch freeway A9 from

however, the probability distribution P (ΔT ) of durations
of high-ﬂow states can be surprisingly well approximated
by the power law

P (ΔT ) = FthrΔT−α , (2)

where Fthr is a proportionality factor and α the power law
exponent. As the distribution P (ΔT ) obviously depends
on the chosen threshold value Qthr, it would be natural
to assume that not only the proportionality factor Fthr,
but also the respective power law exponent α depends on
Qthr. However, Figure 5 suggests that we have α ≈ 2,
irrespective of the value of Qthr. Therefore, we need to

that the exponents, ﬁtted within the interval ΔT ∈ [6, 50] min,

determined from two-minute averages of single vehicle data of
the Dutch freeway A9 close to Amsterdam (after [43]).

ﬁnd an explanation for both, the occurence of the power
law and the value α ≈ 2 of its exponent. Note, however,
that the results of Figure 5 are for a two-lane freeway with
diﬀerent speed limits for cars and trucks. In fact, for the
three-lane freeway A8 close to Munich, Germany, there
is empirical evidence of power laws, but the exponents
somewhat depend on the freeway lane [42]. This will be
relevant for the interpretation of the power law.

3 Interpretation of the power law

3.1 Explanation of 1/f ﬂuctuations by single-lane
models

The empirical power law is quite intriguing, and its in-
terpretation appears to be far from obvious. As the ﬂow
is basically given by the inverse time gaps, however, pe-
riods of high ﬂow must be characterized by short time
gaps between vehicles. Therefore, rather than a homoge-
neous ﬂow with uniform time gaps between vehicles, the
explanation of the above power law (2) must be related
to the occurence of vehicle clusters. Their statistics must
be characterized by largely varying sizes, to generate a
time-dependence of the ﬂow which shares features with a
fractal curve [44,46].

It is conceivable that such a dynamics could be pro-
duced by single-lane traﬃc models implementing a com-
plex vehicle dynamics. In fact, previous publications have
revealed 1/fα ﬂuctuations of the ﬂow and other quan-
tities in empirical data [45] and various traﬃc models.
This includes cellular automata models [46–51], coupled
maps [52], and ﬂuid-dynamics traﬃc models [45,53]. As
none of the publications has studied the frequency dis-
tribution of high-ﬂow states we are focusing on in this
paper, it is hard to say whether it is reproduced by any
of these models. However, since the respective power law



580 The European Physical Journal B

exponents depend on the choice of the model, it is con-
ceivable that equation (2) could be reproduced by suitable
speciﬁcations of one-lane models.

A comparison with the models discussed in Section 1
shows that, besides stochasticity, such a model would have
to contain non-linear vehicle interactions. Otherwise all
cars would ﬁnally queue up behind the slowest vehicle(s)
with identical time gaps, which does not reproduce the
empirical data. 1/f ﬂuctuations of traﬃc ﬂows can, for
example, be explained by turbulent behavior of the noisy
Burgers equation [45]. They can also be derived as result
of self-organized criticality, if the traﬃc state with the
largest throughput is critical and characterized by jams
of all sizes [46,47]. As the dynamics of the underlying
particle hopping models can be related to the stochastic
Burgers equation [54], both approaches are mutually con-
sistent. However, both of them are not so well compatible
with some empirically observed features of congested traf-
ﬁc ﬂows [55,56]. For this reason, the above traﬃc models
have been continuously reﬁned.

In recent models, noise is much less dominating as
compared to the interactions between vehicles, and it is
therefore questionable whether these models show 1/f
ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow dynamics or the power-law (2) of
high-ﬂow states. Furthermore, data for a three-lane free-
way show power laws, but their exponents depend on the
ﬂow threshold Qthr and somewhat on the lane. In particu-
lar, they can be diﬀerent from 2. Therefore, modeling the
high-ﬂow power law based on longitudinal vehicle dynam-
ics may not be the best possible approach, as it cannot
explain the diﬀerence between a freeway with 2 or more
lanes. We rather think that one needs to take into ac-
count the interactions between lanes, i.e. the transversal
dynamics. The model suggested in the following is a ﬁrst
modeling attempt in this direction.

While the above one-lane models basically assume one
vehicle type and ﬁnd 1/f ﬂuctuations primarily in the
congested regime, the following proposal assumes two dis-
tinctly diﬀerent vehicle types (cars and trucks) and implies
a high-ﬂow power law already before the traﬃc ﬂow breaks
down (i.e. before traﬃc becomes unstable and a capacity
drop occurs).

3.2 Multi-lane model of high-ﬂow states based
on vehicle bunching behind overtaking cars

While we do not exclude the possibility of other model-
ing approaches, we will now focus on an interpretation of
our empirical observations, assuming heterogeneous traf-
ﬁc including overtaking maneuvers. As we will see, this
predicts a power law for high-ﬂow states even for deter-
ministic models of longitudinal vehicle interactions. Our
analysis focuses on the case of a two-lane freeway, and it
contains several steps:

1. ﬁrst we will give a qualitative analysis of lane changing
processes;

2. we will argue that they can cause the formation of
vehicle platoons, and that this process is dominated

by overtaking maneuvers at low speed, i.e. primarily
by overtaking maneuvers of trucks;

3. we will determine the statistics of the duration of over-
taking maneuvers by trucks from their speed distribu-
tion;

4. we will give reasons why they couple the dynamics on
both freeway lanes and why the platoons forming on
both lanes are expected to be comparable in size;

5. we will analyze the length of forming vehicle platoons
and the time period until they dissolve;

6. we will show that high-ﬂow vehicle clusters persist for a
very long time, even after the dissolution of the vehicle
platoons;

7. we will discuss, what will be the result, if such vehicle
clusters are measured at a local cross section of the
freeway.

It will turn out that both, the lifetime of vehicle platoons
and the local measurement of vehicle clusters scale with
the duration of the overtaking maneuvers of trucks, and
that the power law of high-ﬂow states results as a super-
position of power laws with the same exponent α = 2.

3.2.1 Qualitative analysis of overtaking maneuvers
on two-lane freeways

In the following, we will assume that the desired velocities
of vehicles are heterogeneous (see Fig. 6). This is typical
for many European countries including Germany and the
Netherlands, where the use of automatic cruise control is
not common. The heterogeneity of desired speeds typi-
cally implies relative velocities among neighboring cars.
The faster car will usually try to overtake a slower ve-
hicle in front. We can distinguish two situations: either
the traﬃc situation on the lane to the left will admit an
overtaking maneuver3, or the vehicle will be obstructed by
a slower vehicle and decelerate to its speed. During light
traﬃc conditions, we may assume unobstructed overtak-
ing most of the time, but already at moderate densities,
long before the breakdown of traﬃc ﬂow, obstructions oc-
cur. These obstructions persist for a certain time period
Δt and lead to the formation of platoons of cars.

Besides the duration of the overtaking maneuver, the
size of the forming vehicle platoon depends primarily on
two factors: (1) the absolute speed diﬀerence between the
overtaking vehicle and the ones following it and (2) the
surrounding vehicle density ρfr. As our high ﬂow power
law concerns time periods from 2 min to 2 h, we are par-
ticularly interested in large vehicle clusters and, therefore,
in the overtaking maneuvers of trucks. These are charac-
terized by particularly long durations Δt and by a large
absolute speed diﬀerence with respect to following cars,
so that a considerable number of vehicles can accumulate
behind the overtaking trucks.

On a two-lane freeway, the overtaking maneuver of
trucks will create a moving bottleneck [57] on both lanes,
while on a freeway with three or more lanes, passing of

3 In Great Britain or Japan, for example, it will be the lane
to the right.

vehicles may still be possible4. The moving bottleneck
propagates at the speed of trucks, i.e. at Vtr ≈ 80 km/h.
Behind this moving bottleneck, more and more vehicles
will accumulate, which generates growing vehicle platoons
(see Fig. 7). Due to lane-changing maneuvers of impatient
drivers, the vehicle platoons on both lanes are expected
to grow approximately at the same speed. Such synchro-
nized behavior of neighboring lanes under obstructed ﬂow
conditions is well-known [59]. However, our calculations
below would also work, if the platoon in one lane would
grow faster by a certain proportionality factor.

3.3 Duration of overtaking maneuvers of trucks

Figure 6 shows the speed distributions of cars and trucks
in free traﬃc of low vehicle density. It can be seen that the
speed of trucks varies around the applicable speed limit
for trucks of 80 km/h, and that the distribution is quite
narrow (i.e. speed diﬀerences are small). Furthermore, the
speed distributions of cars and trucks can be reasonably
well approximated by Gaussian distributions [61,62], in
agreement with theoretical predictions [63,64].

Note that there is no distribution of desired speeds
for trucks in the left lane, as they have to stay in the
right lane according to applicable traﬃc law (when they
do not overtake other vehicles). Overtaking maneuvers are
started whenever two trucks in closeby locations move at

in reference [42] shall be studied in another paper.

Fig. 7. Illustration of a traﬃc breakdown detected on the Ger-
man freeway A5 close to Frankfurt (after [56]). The measure-
ment of a peak in the truck fraction (see solid arrow) is fol-
lowed by a time period of lower speeds and higher ﬂows (see
circles). The spatial extension of the high-ﬂow area is growing
(symbolized by larger circles), while it propagates along the
freeway with about 75 km/h, i.e. at about the truck speed.
We interpret this as growing vehicle platoons behind overtak-
ing trucks. Approximately at kilometer 487, shortly upstream
of a freeway junction characterized by many disturbing lane
changes, the perturbation in the traﬃc ﬂow starts to travel
upstream. While we had a growing spatial extension before,
we now ﬁnd a growing perturbation amplitude (see dashed ar-
row). This eventually causes a breakdown of the traﬃc ﬂow.

diﬀerent speeds, no matter how small the relative velocity
is5. Trucks often enter the left lane relentlessly, without
waiting for a gap, i.e. vehicles in the left lane basically
have to break if a truck driver decides to move over to
the left lane. Moreover, during the overtaking maneuver,
the speed of the trucks usually stays the same6. There-
fore, the distribution of speed diﬀerences Δv between an
overtaking and an overtaken truck can be derived from
the distribution of desired truck speeds in the right lane.

5 Therefore, their frequency depends on the truck density.
6 Trucks, particularly when fully loaded, can hardly acceler-

ate and avoid decelerating.

From statistics, it is well-known that the diﬀerence of
two identically, independently, Gaussian distributed vari-
ables is Gaussian distributed as well. That is, the relative
speeds Δv of trucks obey a Gaussian distribution

N(Δv) dΔv =
1√
2πθ

e−(Δv)
2/(2θ) dΔv. (3)

This will be relevant for the derivation of the high-ﬂow
power law later on.

We will now determine the distribution of the time
period Δt required for the overtaking maneuver of trucks.
If Δleﬀ denotes the typical eﬀective distance, over which
an overtaking maneuver takes place (e.g. Δleﬀ = 20 m)
and Δv is the relative speed between an overtaking vehicle
and the slower one it overtakes, we ﬁnd the proportionality
relation

Δt =
Δleﬀ
Δv

. (4)

As a consequence, the distribution of Δt is given by the
distribution of 1/Δv.

We will now derive the distribution of the variable y =
1/Δv from equation (3) by an appropriate transformation.
Considering

dy

dΔv
= − 1

Δv2
= −y2, (5)

we ﬁnd
N(Δv) dΔv = −N(Δv) 1

y2
dy, (6)

where the minus sign is compensated for by integration
from small to large values of y = 1/Δv rather than vice
versa. Therefore, we get the distribution

P (y) dy =
1√
2πθ

1
y2

e−1/(2θy
2) dy. (7)

In the limit of small speed diﬀerences Δv, i.e. large values
of y, we ﬁnally obtain the power law

P (y) dy ∼ y−2 dy. (8)
Furthermore, as y = 1/Δv ∼ Δt, see equation (4), this
implies the power-law distribution

P (Δt) dΔt ∼ (Δt)−2 dΔt. (9)
As this power law results in the limit of small Δv, equa-
tion (9) is also found, if the distribution of speed diﬀer-
ences of trucks is approximately Gaussian. With this, we
mean

N(Δv) dΔv = N e−p(Δv) dΔv (10)
with a normalization constant N and a Taylor expansion

p(Δv) = a2(Δv)2 + a3(Δv)3 + a4(Δv)4 + . . . (11)

Hence, our conclusions would stay the same, if the distri-
bution would be approximately Gaussian around Δv = 0.
This should be true under the assumptions made above,
namely that an overtaking truck does not change its speed.
According to the observations of the authors, this assump-
tion appears to be quite realistic.

We have now to study, how the distribution of time pe-
riods Δt translates into vehicle platoons behind the trucks
and into high-ﬂow states measured at local cross sections
of the freeway. In particular, we have to explain why the
distribution of high-ﬂow states extends up to 100 min,
while overtaking maneuvers of trucks only take a few min-
utes (in the worst case).

3.3.1 Platoon formation during overtaking maneuvers

As discussed above, it is natural that overtaking maneu-
vers of slow vehicles, particularly trucks, constitute mov-
ing bottlenecks for faster vehicles for some time. These
faster vehicles will be queued up behind the slow ones
(the trucks) and form a platoon. We will now determine
the growth of the platoon length. Intuitively, the number
of vehicles in the platoon grows proportionally with the
time Δt required for the overtaking maneuver of the slow
vehicles.

To quantify this, we may apply the well-known for-
mula for shock propagation (i.e. the propagation of fronts
between areas of diﬀerent density) [65]. Let Ve(ρ) be the
equilibrium speed-density relation and ρfr the density per
lane upstream of the moving bottleneck and the forming
vehicle platoon. Moreover, let ρpl > ρfr be the density
per lane corresponding to the speed Vtr ≈ 80 km/h of
trucks, i.e.

Ve(ρpl) = Vtr. (12)

Finally, let
Qe(ρ) = ρVe(ρ) (13)

represent the equilibrium ﬂow-density relation, which is
sometimes called the “fundamental diagram”7. Then, the
propagation speed of the upstream end of the vehicle pla-
toon forming behind the moving bottleneck is expected
to be

C(ρfr) =
Qe(ρpl)−Qe(ρfr)

ρpl − ρfr =
ρplVtr − ρfrVe(ρfr)

ρpl − ρfr . (14)

Relative to the truck speed Vtr, the propagation speed of
the upstream platoon front can be calculated as

c(ρfr) = C(ρfr)− Vtr = −Ve(ρfr)− Vtr
ρpl/ρfr − 1 < 0. (15)

The negative values imply that the platoon is growing
backwards, as expected. Therefore, the platoon length
lpl(t) grows linearly with the time t at the rate |c(ρfr)|.
After an obstructed time period of duration Δt, the pla-
toon is expected to have the length

lpl(Δt) = |c|Δt. (16)
Note that, in this paper, we assume that the vehicle den-
sity ρpl in the platoon is (meta)stable, i.e.

ρpl < ρc2, (17)
7 While the ﬂow-density data scatter largely in the congested

area, here we require the ﬂow-density relationship in the den-
sity regime before the capacity drop, which is well deﬁned.



D. Helbing and B. Tilch: A power law for the duration of high-ﬂow states 583

see references [6,58]. This situation may be compared
with a “widening synchronized pattern” [58,60], but with
a moving rather than stationary downstream front. The
density ρc2 represents the threshold to linearly unstable
traﬃc.

If relationship (17) is given, traﬃc ﬂow only desta-
bilizes and suﬀers a breakdown of capacity8, if there are
merging ﬂows or strong local perturbations (see the exam-
ple in Fig. 7). Without such perturbations, the platoons
will expand in space without a breakdown of the ﬂow.
Therefore, the outﬂow from the vehicle clusters, after the
trucks have ﬁnished their overtaking maneuver, is given
by the free ﬂow capacity Qmax rather than the congested
ﬂow capacity Qout [58].

3.3.2 Dissolution of vehicle platoons

After the overtaking maneuver is completed and the re-
lated obstruction of the vehicle ﬂow has ended, the vehicle
platoon dissolves linearly in time. Let us denote the maxi-
mum ﬂow by Qmax and the related density by ρmax, where
Qe(ρmax) = Qmax. According to the shock wave equation
for the propagation of discontinuous density changes [65],
the dissolution speed is then given by [58]

C∗ =
Qe(ρmax)/2−Qe(ρpl)

ρmax − ρpl =
ρmaxVe(ρmax)/2− ρplVtr

ρmax − ρpl ,
(18)

where the factor 1/2 takes into account that only one of
the two lanes, namely the left lane is free to dissolve the
vehicle platoon, after the overtaking maneuver of trucks
is ﬁnished. Relative to the truck velocity Vtr, the propa-
gation speed is

c∗ = C∗ − Vtr = −Ve(ρmax)/2− Vtr
ρpl/ρmax − 1 . (19)

The dissolution process takes a time period Δt∗. While
the vehicle platoon dissolves at the front, further vehicles
are joining it at its end. Therefore, we have the relation

lpl(Δt) + |c|Δt∗ = |c∗|Δt∗. (20)
This results in

Δt∗ =
|c|Δt
|c∗| − |c| =

Δt

|c∗|/|c| − 1 . (21)

Hence, the existence of a platoon is observed for an overall
time period of

ΔT∗ = Δt∗ + Δt =
Δt

1− |c|/|c∗| ≥ Δt. (22)

The quotient in the denominator can be determined as

Fig. 8. Illustration of the various densities and ﬂows deter-
mining the formation and dissolution of vehicle platoons. We
have ρfr ≤ ρmax and assume ρmax < ρpl < ρc2, which supports
the (meta-)stability of vehicle platoons. Therefore, they may
persist over a considerable time period without a breakdown
of “high-ﬂow states”.

Note the relationships

ρfr ≤ ρmax < ρpl (24)
and

Ve(ρfr) ≥ Ve(ρmax) > Ve(ρpl) (25)
(see Fig. 8). Therefore, equations (22) and (23) imply a
platoon to exist for a time period ΔT∗ = Δt, if ρfr → 0,
while it will exist for an extremely long time as Qe(ρfr)→
Qmax/2. Consequently, at low vehicle densities, most pla-
toons are expected to dissolve quickly. However, at mod-
erate densities, the lifetime ΔT∗ = Δt + Δt∗ can be quite
long and even diverge. This (and the persistence of high-
ﬂow vehicle clusters after the dissolution of platoons, see
next subsection) is the reason, why overtaking maneuvers
on the scale of minutes can have eﬀects on much longer
time scales.

3.3.3 Measurement of high-flow states

We will now have to relate the existence of vehicle platoons
to the local measurement of high-ﬂow states. When a ve-
hicle platoon passes a cross section of the road, the traﬃc
ﬂow is particularly high due to the small time gaps be-
tween its vehicles. In comparison with the situation before
the overtaking maneuver of trucks, the time gaps between
the freely ﬂowing cars are considerably reduced. That is,
the ﬂow is still higher than Qe(ρfr), the ﬂow before pla-
toon formation, even after the vehicle platoon has dis-
solved. The related vehicle clusters are expected to exist
for a long time, much longer than the previous vehicle
platoon9. The corresponding ﬂows in both lanes qualify
as high-ﬂow states, if they are larger than Qthr.

9 There are basically two ways for them to disappear: 1) ve-
hicles leave the cluster via oﬀ-ramps of the freeway; 2) clusters



584 The European Physical Journal B

Let us now estimate the ﬂow in both lanes after the
overtaking maneuver of trucks is ﬁnished. Then, vehicles
will pass the truck in the right lane at the maximum ﬂow
rate Qmax. This ﬂow will be distributed over both free-
way lanes. A fraction β = β(ρfr) will switch to the right
lane, while a fraction (1− β) will stay on the left lane. In
the right lane, in front of the overtaken truck, there will
be some additional truck traﬃc. If γ denotes the average
fraction of truck traﬃc on both freeway lanes, this corre-
sponds to an average truck traﬃc ﬂow of Qtr ≈ γQe(ρfr).
Considering that most of these trucks are in the right lane,
the overall ﬂow on the right lane after a completed over-
taking maneuver of trucks may be estimated as

Qright(ρfr, t) ≈ β(ρfr)Qmax + 2γ(t)Qe(ρfr). (26)
In the left lane, we approximately expect to ﬁnd the ﬂow

Qleft(ρfr, t) ≈ [1− β(ρfr)]Qmax. (27)
While the ﬂow Qleft is typically above 2000 vehicles per
hour (we estimate that β ≈ 0.35), the ﬂow in the right lane
exceeds high ﬂow thresholds Qthr as well, if the surround-
ing density ρfr and the truck fraction γ are large enough.
Therefore, after an overtaking maneuver of trucks, we ex-
pect to ﬁnd high-ﬂow states in both lanes10. We will now
have to determine the time period over which they are
measured.

Previously, we have studied vehicle clusters in a moving
coordinate system, speciﬁcally in a system moving at the
speed of trucks. Our empirical distribution of high-ﬂow
states, however, has been measured at a local cross section
of a two-lane freeway. In order to see how this aﬀects the
measurement, it is useful to consult Figure 9.

We see that the time period ΔT of high-ﬂow clusters
is basically given by Δt∗, which is proportional to Δt, see
equation (21). The proportionality factor

A(ρfr) =
1

|c∗|/|c(ρfr)| − 1 (28)

depends on the surrounding vehicle density ρfr. But given
a certain density ρfr, we have the proportionality ΔT−2 ∼
Δt−2. Together with the power law distribution (9) for
Δt, this implies the power law distribution

P (ΔT, ρfr) ∼ (ΔT )−2 ∼ (Δt)−2. (29)
As only the proportionality factor, but not the exponent
α = 2 depends on the density ρfr, the superposition of
distributions for diﬀerent values of ρfr is again a power
law with exponent α = 2:

P (ΔT ) ∼ (ΔT )−2 ∼ Δt−2. (30)
Therefore, we have shown that the measured duration ΔT
of vehicle platoons is distributed according to a power law

disperse due to a variation of the vehicle speeds, which can be
approximated by continuity equations for cars and trucks with
diﬀusion terms, see the appendix.
10 At least if Qleft, Qright > Qthr and Qmax + 2γQe(ρfr) >
2Qe(ρfr).

Fig. 9. Schematic illustration of vehicle trajectories on the
left lane before, during, and after an overtaking maneuver of
trucks. The triangular area represents the growth and disso-
lution of a vehicle cluster. When measuring the ﬂow after the
dissolution of the platoon at some freeway cross section x, one
expects to detect the free ﬂow Qe(ρfr), then a low-ﬂow period
in front of the overtaking trucks, afterwards a high-ﬂow period,
and ﬁnally again free ﬂow. The measured duration ΔT of the
high-ﬂow state, which is expected to persist for a long time, is
basically given by Δt∗.

P (ΔT ) ∼ (ΔT )−α with α = 2, in agreement with the
empirical measurement of high-ﬂow states represented by
equation (2).

4 Summary and outlook

In this paper, we have revealed a power law for the dura-
tion of high-ﬂow states, where “high ﬂow” means higher
than some given threshold Qthr. Not only was it surpris-
ing to ﬁnd that our empirical data could be approximated
by a power law, but also that the power law exponents α
for the lanes of a two-lane freeway were approximately 2,
irrespective of the ﬂow threshold Qthr.

Therefore, it was natural to look for an explanation of
these surprising ﬁndings. As the dependence of the expo-
nents on the number of freeway lanes does not support
explanations based on the longitudinal vehicle dynamics,
we have studied a model based on the transversal vehicle
dynamics, i.e. lane changes11. Our hypothesis was that
high-ﬂow states occured due to vehicle platoons, and that
these vehicle platoons would be caused by lasting over-
taking maneuvers of slow vehicles, particularly of trucks.
11 An alternative modeling approach, however, may be based
on modiﬁcations of the one-lane models for vehicle platoons
discussed in Section 1, if the exponent is (made) dependent on
the number of lanes.



D. Helbing and B. Tilch: A power law for the duration of high-ﬂow states 585

Based on an approximate Gaussian distribution of the
speed diﬀerence of trucks, we could, in fact, derive the
empirical power law and the exponent α = 2. For this, we
have studied the duration of overtaking maneuvers, the re-
sulting lifetime of forming vehicle platoons, and the mea-
surement process at a cross section of the freeway. The
lifetime ΔT∗ of a vehicle platoon and the measurement
ΔT of the related high-ﬂow vehicle cluster are propor-
tional to the duration Δt of overtaking maneuvers. This
circumstance transfers the power law of the time periods
Δt to the periods of the high-ﬂow states. The powerlaw
itself results from the approximate Gaussian distribution
of relative speeds Δv, the fact that the duration Δt of
overtaking maneuvers is inversely proportional to Δv, and
the domination of long-lasting overtaking maneuvers with
Δv ≈ 0.

Appendix A: Dispersion of vehicle clusters

For each vehicle class a (i.e. cars and trucks), the disper-
sion of vehicle clusters is described by the traﬃc pressure
Pa(x, t) = ρa(x, t)θa(x, t), which is proportional to the
vehicle density ρa(x, t) of vehicle type a and its velocity
variance θa(x, t) as a function of location x and time t [66].
In the limit of small adaptation times τa for the velocity
relaxation, the average speed Va of vehicle class a may be
approximated by

Va(x, t) = V ea

equation (A.1) into the continuity equation for each vehi-
cle class, the dispersion of vehicle clusters due to diﬀerent
speeds can be reﬂected by diﬀusion terms Dab∂2ρb/∂x2
