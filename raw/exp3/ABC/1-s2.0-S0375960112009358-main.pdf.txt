nchronized outﬂow

Introduction

The systematic and thorough investigation of traﬃc ﬂow has
ite a long history [1–10]. Various traﬃc phenomena have been
served, e.g. phantom jams, hysteresis effects, metastable states
d stop-and-go traﬃc etc. Different explanations of these empir-
al ﬁndings and traﬃc ﬂow models have been proposed. Most
these models [11–20] can be classiﬁed into the fundamental

agram approach, which postulates that the steady traﬃc ﬂow
longs to a curve in the ﬂow-density plane. However, Kerner
inted out that these models within the fundamental diagram
proach cannot explain traﬃc breakdown and many signiﬁcant
atures of congested patterns induced by bottlenecks (see [9,10]).
aﬃc breakdown simulated by these models is the transition from
ee ﬂow to wide moving jams. A wide moving jam is a mov-
g jam that maintains the mean velocity of the downstream jam
ont, even when the jam propagates through other traﬃc phases
bottlenecks. While empirical ﬁndings show that traﬃc break-
wn is the ﬁrst order transition from free ﬂow to synchronized
w (F → S transition). In contrast with the wide moving jam
ase, the downstream front of the synchronized ﬂow phase does
t exhibit the wide moving jam characteristic feature. In particu-
r, the downstream front of the synchronized ﬂow phase is often
ed at a bottleneck.

Based on the three phases, i.e. free ﬂow, synchronized ﬂow and
wide moving jams, an alternative traﬃc ﬂow theory called three-
phase traﬃc theory is introduced by Kerner et al. [9,10,21–25],
which can predict and explain the empirical spatiotemporal fea-
tures of traﬃc breakdown and the resulting traﬃc congestion at an
isolated bottleneck successfully. Empirical observations reported by
Kerner [9,10] show that there are two types of congested patterns
at an isolated bottleneck:

The General Patterns (GPs): After the synchronized ﬂow occurs
upstream of the bottleneck, the wide moving jams continuously
emerge in that synchronized ﬂow and propagate upstream, and
then this congested pattern is often called as the General Pattern
(GP). However, if the wide moving jams discontinuous emerge on
the road, there will just be one or few wide moving jams appear-
ing in that synchronized ﬂow, then this congested pattern is often
called as the dissolving general pattern (DGP).

The Synchronized Patterns (SPs): If there only exists synchro-
nized ﬂow upstream of the bottleneck, no wide moving jams
emerge in the synchronized ﬂow, and then this congested pattern
is often called as the Synchronized Patterns. And as a result of
the F → S transition, various synchronized ﬂow patterns can oc-
cur at the bottleneck, such as the widening synchronized pattern
(WSP), local synchronized pattern (LSP), moving synchronized pat-
tern (MSP).

The fundamental hypothesis of three-phase theory is that the
hypothetical steady states of the synchronized ﬂow cover a two-
dimensional region in the ﬂow-density plane, i.e. there is no fun-
damental diagram of traﬃc ﬂow in this theory. Subsequently, many

aﬃc ﬂow models have been proposed in the framework of three-
ase traﬃc theory [25–35]. In order to emphasize the signiﬁcance
the two-dimensional steady states of synchronized ﬂow, Kerner
d Klenov proposed the speed adaption three-phase traﬃc mod-
s (SA models) [27] in the framework of fundamental diagram
proach. The basic hypothesis of SA models is the double Z-
aracteristic for the sequence of phase transitions from free ﬂow
synchronized ﬂow to wide moving jams (F → S → J transi-

ons). Based on this hypothesis, SA models can reproduce both
e traﬃc breakdown and the emergence of wide moving jams
synchronized ﬂow as found in empirical observations. How-
er, SA models are not able to reproduce the local synchronized
tterns (LSPs) consistent with empirical results as well as some
empirical features of synchronized ﬂow between wide moving

ms within general patterns (GPs). Kerner et al. attribute these
awbacks of SA models to the lacking of the two-dimensional
eady states of synchronized ﬂow. At the same time, it is worth
ying that models in the three-phase theory, such as the KKW
odel [28], could not reproduce some empirical ﬁndings as well.
e KKW model cannot simulate a single moving synchronized
ttern (MSP) as well as an LSP whose width changes over time
served in real traﬃc [29].
Recently, a simple cellular automaton named the average space
p model (ASGM) [36] within the fundamental diagram approach
as proposed to reproduce some empirical ﬁndings of the three-
ase traﬃc theory. ASGM can reproduce the F → S → J transi-

ons, the single MSP, and other congested patterns induced by an
-ramp that are in line with empirical results. However, the syn-
ronized outﬂow of wide moving jams cannot be reproduced by
GM. Thus, ASGM needs to be improved since this defect leads to
e absence of only synchronized ﬂow existing between wide mov-
g jams in GP, which is one of the key aspects of the criticisms
at three-phase theory is made on the fundamental diagram ap-
oach. In this Letter, an improved ASGM is established by taking
e velocity effect and critical velocity into account. The physics
traﬃc breakdown and the mechanism of the synchronized out-
w and free outﬂow of wide moving jams are explained by the
proved model.

The model

The essential mechanisms to reproduce three-phase traﬃc the-
y in the improved model are embodied in the randomization
ocess of vehicles. The parallel update rules are as follows.

ff
(t) = dn(t) + max(0,min(vn+1(t) + 1,dn+1(t), vmax) − dsafe) is

e safe space gap between vehicle n and its preceding vehicle
+ 1, and dsafe is the safe factor to avoid accidents. dn(t) is the
tual gap, dn(t) = xn+1(t)− xn(t)− Lcar . xn(t) is the position of ve-
cle n (here vehicle n + 1 precedes vehicle n). This is the velocity
fect that the velocity of vehicle n depends not only on the posi-
ons of itself and vehicle n + 1, but also on the velocity of vehicle
+ 1. Lcar is the length of the vehicle, and vn(t) is the velocity
the vehicle n. tstn (t) denotes the time that a car stops. When the
r has stopped for a certain time that is larger than or equal to tc ,
e driver will become less sensitive. davgn (t) is deﬁned to model
e anticipation effect of taking ml vehicles in front into account.
order to describe it, the value of ml should be large enough,
ggesting ml � 2. vc is the critical velocity to simulate the situ-
ion that when the speed is smaller enough, the driver will not
ke ml − 1 vehicles in front of the leading vehicle into account. If
afe and vc are set as min(vn+1(t) + 1,dn+1(t), vmax) and zero re-
ectively, ASGM can be obtained. This improved model is named
e improved averaged space gap cellular automaton model, abbre-
ated as IASGM.
The basic driver behaviors in IASGM are as follows: (i) for suf-
iently large space gaps in free ﬂow, drivers will accelerate until
e maximum speed vmax , since d

avg
n and d

eff
n is greater than or

ual to vmax . Behaviors of this kind can be named as free driv-
g effect, which is realized by rule (3) in IASGM. (ii) For relatively
all space gaps in synchronized ﬂow, drivers have to trade be-
een davgn and d

eff
n . If d

avg
n is higher than d

eff
n , the driver will

just to deffn ; otherwise, the driver will turn up to d
avg
n . Further-

ore, drivers become more defensive when the actual speed is
gher than davgn . The actual behavioral change is characterized by
creasing the randomization probability from pc to pa , and the
sociated deceleration from b to a. This behavior is named as an-
cipation driving effect, which is fulﬁlled by rules (4) and (5) in
SGM.

Fundamental diagram

Fundamental diagram approach postulates that the steady traf-
ﬂow forms a curve in the ﬂow-density plane. Correspondingly,

is curve going through the origin with at least one maximum
called the fundamental diagram for traﬃc ﬂow. In the unper-
rbed, noiseless limit, models within the fundamental diagram
proach will have a fundamental diagram of steady states [10].
e fundamental diagram is either hypothesized in these models
.g. the optimal velocity model [18]), or the fundamental diagram
a result of these models (e.g. the Nagel–Schreckenberg cellular
tomaton model (NaSch model) [17]).
In what follows, we show that the steady states of IASGM have

fundamental diagram of steady states in the unperturbed, noise-
ss limit according to Kerner’s method [10]. Since the mechanisms
sociated with the synchronized ﬂow in IASGM are all embod-
d in the randomization process, the noiseless limit should be
ken as pa = 1, pc = 0, pb = 0 or pa = 1, pc = 1, pb = 1. How-
er, all vehicles will keep stationary no matter how far distance
tween vehicles in the latter case, which is obviously unrealis-
c. Thus, we just consider the former. Steady states of traﬃc ﬂow

us, vn � davgn and pn = pc . On the basis of rules (2), (3) and (4),
e steady states are given by the equality: vn = deffn . This con-
tion together with vn � vmax deﬁned the steady state of the
SGM: vn = min(deffn , vmax). This equation can be written as the
nditions for the gap d and the vehicle speed v: v = min(d +
ax(0,min(v + 1,d, vmax) − dsafe), vmax), which form a curve of
e steady states in the ﬂow-density plane, i.e. the fundamental
agram (see Fig. 1, see Appendix A for the derivation for the fun-
mental diagram).

Simulations and discussions

Simulations are implemented on a road with length Lroad =
00Lcell . Each cell has the length of Lcell = 1.5 m, and the length
a vehicle is Lcar = 7.5 m, i.e. ﬁve cells could accommodate
ly one vehicle (Lcar = 5). The maximum velocity vmax is set as
ax = 20, and the velocity of each vehicle is an integer, which
nges from 0 to vmax . One time step corresponds to 1 s. The
her parameters are as follows: pa = 0.95, pb = 0.5, pc = 0.03,
= 3, b = 1, tc = 4, ml = 3, dsafe = 7, vc = 3. During the simu-
tions, ﬁrst 10 000 time steps are discarded to let the transient
e die out.
Simulations are carried out near an on-ramp under open
undary condition. The vehicles move from left to right. The
ft-most cell corresponds to x = 1. The position of the left-most
hicle is xlast and that of the right-most vehicle is xlead . At each
e step, if xlast > vmax , a new vehicle with velocity vmax will
injected to the position min(xlast − vmax, vmax) with probabil-
qin . If xlead > Lroad , the leading vehicle will be removed and the

llowing vehicle becomes the leader.
A simple method is adopted to model the on-ramp [34]. Assum-

g the position of the on-ramp is xon , a region [xon, xon + Lon-ramp]
selected as the inserting area of the vehicle from on-ramp. At
ch time step, the longest gap in this region is found out. If the
p is large enough for a vehicle, then a new vehicle will be in-
rted at the cell in the middle of the gap with probability qon . The
locity of the inserted vehicle is set as the velocity of its preced-
g vehicle, and the stop time is set to zero. The parameters are
t as xon = 0.8Lroad and Lon-ramp = 50.
1. The physics of traﬃc breakdown

According to the basic driver behaviors in IASGM, a competition
tween two opposite tendencies can be found, i.e., the tendency
wards to free ﬂow due to the free driving effect and the tendency
wards to synchronized ﬂow owing to the anticipation driving ef-
ct. This competition occurs within a local disturbance in which
e speed is lower and density is higher than in the initial free
w.
Due to this competition, traﬃc breakdown phenomenon can be
plained as follows: free ﬂow maintains on the road provided that
e free driving effect is stronger than the anticipation driving ef-
ct when the density is small enough on the road, i.e., the space
ps between vehicles are large enough. However, the greater the
nsity the smaller the space gaps, the weaker the free driving
fect and the stronger the synchronized driving effect. After the
itical point is exceeded, where the free driving effect works the
me as the synchronized driving effect, traﬃc breakdown happens
d synchronized ﬂow begins to emerge in free ﬂow.
This competition is shown in Fig. 2, which exhibits the spa-
temporal characteristic of MSP. At the time interval between
800 s and 21850 s, vehicles 1, 2 are inserted in the on-ramp
gion. The inserted vehicle 1 leads to the ﬁrst disturbance. Due to
e small space gaps from vehicle 3 to vehicle 12, each following
hicle moving in front of vehicle 11 must slow down when en-
ring into the disturbance, which means the predominance of the
ticipation driving effect. However, since the large distance be-
een vehicle 5 and vehicle 6, vehicle 7 and vehicle 8, vehicle 9
d vehicle 10, the anticipation effect become more and more
eaker, the free driving effect is getting stronger when this dis-
rbance propagates upstream. Due to the large distance between
hicle 11 and vehicle 12, the anticipation effect is weaker than
e free driving effect. As a result, the speed of vehicle 12 just
ightly ﬂuctuates and reverts to the free speed quickly, i.e. the
st disturbance diminishes. The inserted vehicle 2 causes another
sturbance, and the speed of the following vehicles decrease. Ow-
g to the small space gaps between them, the anticipation driving
fect is stronger than the free driving effect. Consequently, the
eed ﬂuctuations grow and propagate upstream, leading to occur-
nce of MSP.
Moreover, it is known that traﬃc breakdown has the probabilis-
nature at a bottleneck, i.e., at a given upstream ﬂow rate of a
ttleneck, traﬃc breakdown could occur or not [9,10,37–39]. In
der to investigate this property at the on-ramp, the method pro-
sed by Kerner et al. [28] is applied. Np simulations of the same
e interval T0 are carried out for the given rates qsum and qon ,

here qsum = qin + qon . For each simulation, whether breakdown
curs within T0 has been checked. The result of Np simulations
the number of realizations np where breakdown occurs. Then
B)
S = np/Np is the approximate probability the traﬃc breakdown
ppens in an initial free ﬂow during the time interval T0. Fig. 3
ows that the probability that traﬃc breakdown happens within
given time interval increases exponentially with the ﬂux qsum ,
hich is in accordance with the empirical ﬁndings and the simu-
tions result of models in the three-phase theory.

2. Spatiotemporal congested patterns

When traﬃc breakdown happens near the on-ramp, various
ngested patterns can occur. These congested patterns are plot-
d in Fig. 4. Different values of qin and qon have induced six
stinct congested patterns predicted by the three-phase theory.
Fig. 4(a), the spatial-temporal features of moving synchronized
w (MSP) are shown. In this pattern, synchronized traﬃc ﬂow
ontaneously emerges in the free ﬂow. Both the downstream
ont and upstream front of MSP propagate upstream. Fig. 4(b)

hibits the widening synchronized ﬂow (WSP). The downstream
ont of WSP is ﬁxed at the on-ramp and the upstream front of
SP propagates upstream continuously over time. In Fig. 4(c), the
wnstream front of synchronized ﬂow is also ﬁxed at the on-
mp. However, differing with WSP, the upstream front of synchro-
zed ﬂow is not continuously widening but ﬂuctuates as time go-
g. The region of synchronized ﬂow is limited near the on-ramp.
us, it belongs to the local synchronized pattern (LSP). Fig. 4(d)
ows the dissolving general patterns (DGP) in which just one
ide moving jam emerges in the synchronized ﬂow, which means
e S → J transition could be reproduced by IASGM. Fig. 4(e)
ows the spatial-temporal features of general pattern (GP). One
n see that a sequence of wide moving jams occurs in synchro-
zed ﬂow in GP.
It is necessary to illustrate the difference among IASGM, ASGM
d SA models, since IASGM is based on ASGM and all of which
e in the framework of fundamental diagram approach. SA models

have been criticized because they could not reproduce some em-
pirical phenomena, i.e. LSPs and GPs consistent with empirical
data. The LSPs reproduced by SA models are very narrow ones,
which are localized within the merging regions of the on-ramp
and consist of two narrow fronts only. And there is no synchro-
nized ﬂow between the fronts within these LSPs. Fig. 4(c) shows
that the width of LSP reproduced by IASGM in the longitudinal di-
rection changes over time, which is in accordance with empirical
observations. Moreover, only free ﬂow can be formed in the down-
stream front of wide moving jams within the GP in SA models,
which is also the truth for ASGM. However, Fig. 4(f) shows that
the state that only synchronized ﬂow exists between wide mov-
ing jams in GP could be simulated if one reduce the value of the
slow-to-start probability pb . It is known to all that the slow-to-
start probability pb is close with τ

alent to decreasing τ (a)del,jam , which means decreasing the average

us, synchronized ﬂow can be formed at the downstream of wide
oving jams.
Finally, the impact of the safe space gap dsafe and the critical
locity vc on the outﬂow of wide moving jams is investigated.
mparing Fig. 5(a) with (b), the following conclusions can be
ade: (i) Both them have nothing to do with the synchronized
tﬂow. (ii) Without the critical velocity vc , the free outﬂow could

not be simulated. Actually, considering vc helps to enhance free
driving effect. Thus, it is possible that the free driving effect is
stronger than the anticipation effect, which means free outﬂow can
be reproduced.

5. Conclusion

The improved average space gap cellular automaton model
(IASGM) within the fundamental diagram approach has been
proposed by taking the velocity effect and critical velocity into

count. The physics of traﬃc breakdown is explained by the
mpetition between two opposite tendencies, i.e. the tendency to-
ards to free ﬂow due to the free driving effect and the tendency
wards to synchronized ﬂow owing to the anticipation driving
fect. The probabilistic nature of traﬃc breakdown is simulated.
e signiﬁcant contribution is the discovery that the occurrence of
nchronized outﬂow of wide moving jams has a close relation-
ip with drivers time delay in acceleration at the downstream
m front, and the emergence of free outﬂow is closely connected
ith the critical velocity.
Except for above investigations of IASGM in this Letter, there

e still many other features worth studying in the future. Firstly,
e microscopic properties, such as the time headway distribu-
ons, the empirical optimal velocity functions. It has been reported
at the time headway distribution has a cut off at the small time
adway, which is less than one second [40,41]. Obviously, it is
possible for the ASGM due to the lack of velocity effect. Sec-
dly, the two-lane version of IASGM should be developed. It will
very interesting to simulate and compare the results with [24].

4] argues that macroscopic and microscopic spatiotemporal ef-
cts of the entire complexity of traﬃc congestion observed up
now in real measured traﬃc data can be explained by simu-

tions of traﬃc ﬂow consisting of identical drivers and vehicles,
a microscopic model used in these simulations incorporates the
ndamental hypothesis of three-phase theory. Finally, whether the
currence of synchronized outﬂow of wide moving jams depends
drivers time delay in acceleration at the downstream jam front
not should be surveyed in other traﬃc ﬂow models.
