Abstract 

By the use of the methods proposed in a recent article we were able to shed some fight on 
the experimentally obtained flux-density relation in traffic flow. We suggest an order parameter 
showing the existence of two regimes in freeway traffic. We also introduce the case of traffic at 
signal condition, analysing the effects of convenient traffic parameters on the flux-density diagram. 

1. Introduction 

Traditionally, the treatment of the problem of traffic flow was based on the analysis 

of experimental data. However, the poverty of data in critical regions led to a series 
of different interpretations about the behaviour of relations among the fundamental 
traffic parameters, density and flux. These include proposals so divergent as the "reverse 

lambda", discontinuous, and continuous forms for flow-occupancy relationships ( [ 1 ] and 

references therein). In part this is caused by the absence of criteria in the experimental 
methods used, showing the lack of an adequate theoretical approach to the problem to 
guide this research. Besides, some earlier analyses seem not to have taken precisely into 
consideration these same methods, as it was argued in [ 1 ]. This question remains open 

until now. 
The first theoretical models were based on fluid and nonlinear equations [2-6] .  They 

were well suited to treat traffic at very high or low car densities, but could not be 
trivially extended to the whole interval of observable densities. So they could not be of

much help in clearing up the precise flow-occupancy relationship. For this reason, and 
for the fact that we intend to examine the particular problem of signalized ways, we 
base our work in the recently introduced cellular automata (CA) traffic models [7]. 

In the next section we give a review of this model. In Section 3 we define the 
convenient parameters and show the diagrams for freeway transit. Nextly we introduce 
the case of traffic under signal constraints. In the conclusion we hope to give a possible 
explanation to the experimental problem about the critical region of the flux-density 
diagram. 

2. The  mode l  

The use of a CA approach to model traffic flowing along a line was made by K. 
Nagel and M. Schreckenberg [7]. They obtained a nice agreement with experimental 
data, which signed the correctness of the proposal. 

The CA were constituted of an array of L sites, each site being occupied by one car 
(with integer velocity v) or being empty. The parallel update rules were the following: 
(i) vj --* vj + 1 if the distance of the jth car to the next car is greater than vj + 1, 

and taking vj = V,~x as a limit. 
( i i )  vj ~ d - 1 if the distance to the next car is d <_ vj. 

(iii) vj ~ vj - 1 with a random probability p if vj >_ 1. 
(iv) The jth car is advanced vj sites. 

Other works then followed using this technique [8,9]. In this paper, we will join 
some new rules to the basic automatum presented above, in order to have a wider 
comprehension of the cases we want to study. They will be introduced sequentially 
along the text. 

3. Free traff ic 

Here we consider a line with periodic boudary condition (closed circuit), with a 
random initial distribution of car positions and null initial velocities. We want to study 
the properties of the fundamental (flux × density) diagram. So, we define the parameters

and

The first expression represents the density of cars on the site i (Si) over a time period 
T; to is the relaxation time, usually taken as to = 10 x L, following the prescription

of [7]; hi(t) is zero if Si is empty and one if it is occupied at time t. The second 
expression represents the flux of cars on Si; mi(t) is one if at time t - 1 there was a 
car behind or at Si and at t it is found after Si (i.e., a car is detected passing by Si) and 
zero otherwise• 

To look for a possible transition between a free and a jammed phase, we also define 
a parameter 

to+T 1 
ffli = 1 - 2T~----~ ~ li(t) , (3) 

t=to + 1 

where l i(t) is one if at time t - 1 Si is occupied (empty) and at time t it is empty 
(occupied); l i(t) is zero if at both times Si is occupied or empty• This choice of 
parameter is made on the consideration that a jammed regime means that all cars are 
grouped in long clusters• 

Obviously, for free traffic, as this system is a homogeneous one due to the considered 
boundary conditions, none of these parameters will be position dependent• So, along 
this section the subindex i will be omitted. 

In Fig. 1 we show the cases with T --- 100 and T = 10000 (L -- 1000). The first 
presents the natural dispersion of points that is expected for the low accuracy caused by 
the small interval of time for the measurements. This kind of dispersion is exactly what 
is seen in the experimental data (see for exemple the comparison of Figs. 4 and 5 of  
Ref. [7] ). It is not easy to establish any conclusion from such experimental diagrams, 
what has led to the discussion of what would be the correct form of the flux-density 
relation [ 1 ]. With higher values of T, we see that we can improve this until the obtention 
of  a well defined curve is achieved. This is the most favourable point of this approach•

In the low density limit, the exact solution for any v,,~x and p can be easily obtained 
by analising the evolution of the automatum for one car, and appears as 

q = (Vma= - p)p  , (4) 

and we see that in this limit p just scales the maximum velocity to a lower value. At 
high density, the asymptotic behaviour can be obtained by the reasoning that this system 
presents a kind of "particle-hole" symmetry, with a hole appearing with a Umax = 1 
independently of the Urea= of the particle. So, in this limit, 

q= (1 -p ) (1  -p )  (5) 

For p = 0 we observe by numerical results that only the two regimes above exist. We 
always find q = Vm~xP if p < 1/( 1 + v) and q = 1 -p  otherwise. So, the exact result for 
this CA when p = 0, but with an arbitrary Vr~x = v, is given by the implicit equation 

v 1 (v~v - v/1 + 0 2) 
q= ~-~v + (P - ]---~v) -( -~ ~_ ~ ~ ~-~

(~/~ + iyq__~__b~ ) - ~-~--~v ) + (q - ~--+--~v ) (v/~ + ~ ) (6) 

Some solutions for different v are plotted in Fig. 2. The point that we observe is that, 
by the definitions we used for q and p, all the curves in the graphic of q against p, 
independently of u and p ,  cannot transpose the line q = 1 -p .  This condition is fulfilled 
by the solution of Eq. (4), where the flux rises until it meets this line in the point 

p=l / ( l+u)  , q=v/ ( l+v)  (7)

and then falls along it. This agrees with the particular solution obtained in Ref. [8] in 

the limit when we have Vmax = 1. 
Although our solution is restricted to the case p = 0, the independence of this no- 

crossing statement on the values of p happens because a non-zero value of p just makes 

the probability of occurence of higher velocities low. So, for a given density, the value 

of the flux has to be lower (or equal) than in the case of a null p. 

Here, we make a change in relation to the basic CA of last section. We do not take 

a fixed value of V,n,~x for all cars, but rather a Vmax distribution between a low, VL, and 
a high, vH, velocity. 

In this numerical treatment, the change of a fixed Um,~x to a random distribution of 
maximum velocities showed that the shape of the curves remained unchanged, but now 

the Vmax that appears in the formulas above should be understood as the lowest value of 
the distribution (vL).  An interesting point is that the existence of a sole car with VL is 

sufficient to make this change, no matter how high is vn. 

The order parameter is shown in Fig. 3, where it is plotted against p for several values 

of Cm~x (p = 0). There we see two distinct regions. The first, where the parameter is 
zero, is associated with a free regime. The cars are able to develop their maximum 
velocity, which means that there is no correlation between them. After a transition 
point the order parameter is not zero anymore, representing the region associated with a 
jammed phase 2. The critical density pc is a function of the maximum velocity and for 

p = 0 it is given by Eq. (5).  We show this phase diagram in Fig. 4. As an observation, 

we comment that the value of L = I000 is already sufficient to assure the thermodynamic 

2 A more detailed and complete analysis of the criticality of this model is under preparation.

limit, i.e., increasing this value does not change these results. 
We would like to point out now the similarity between our results about the phase 

description above and what was obtained by Nagatani [ 10]. This happens because our 
parameter M is directly related to the parameter which he called "mean velocity" ((v) = 
1 - M when Vmax = 1 ), since the ergodicity of the CA admits identifying spatial means 
of measurements done at a fixed time with temporal means of measurements done at a 
fixed position. We observe that the characteristics of this transition are already completely 
described just considering an one-lane traffic model. It seems that the inclusion of an 
extra lane, introduced by Nagatani, does not bring any further insight on them. 

4. Traf f ic  l ight  

Our motivation for the analysis of traffic under a stop-and-go condition lies in the 
problem noticed by Lighthill and Whitham [2] of the existence of a non-functional 
relation between flux and density obtained from avaiable experimental data (see Fig. 19 
of Ref. [2] ). This was against the theoretical results, and none satisfactory explanation 
was given by them. 

Our changes in the basic CA of Section 2 begin by the inclusion of N traffic lights 
equally spaced along the array. We define the time of duration of green, yellow and red 
lights as Tg, Ty and T,., respectively. The duration of the full cycle is To During Tg all 
cars move freely following the rules of the basic CA. During Tr the signal behaves as a 
car with zero velocity, stopping the cars behind it. Ty avoids the possibility of having a 
car with velocity greater than the distance ds to the signal just at the moment of change

from green to red light. During Ty we consider the car immediately before the signal 
(with velocity v and distance ds to the signal) which will obey the rules: 
(i) I f v (Ty  - 1) > ds then the car will follow the rules of the basic CA. 
(ii) If v(Ty - 1) _< ds then the car will follow the rules for the red signal. 

A typical flux-density graphic is shown in Fig. 5. It was obtained with several "radars" 
(where the measurements are made) at different positions in relation to each signal. 
This has to be taken into consideration because the signals create an inhomogeneity in 
the system. The existence of two well defined curves can be now easily explained. The 
one at higher densities is related to measurements made at distances from the traffic light 
smaller than the mean size of the queue generated by the signal. The other is related 
to measurements made at distances bigger than this mean size. So for a given number 
of cars, there will be two classes of measurements giving two different densities for the 
same flux. We notice that both curves have the same maximum. 

In Fig. 6 we show the curve obtained by only one radar at a distance dr from a signal. 
We see that when the number of cars increases so that the mean queue size gets higher 
than dr, the behaviour of the measured flux changes from the low to the high density 
curve of Fig. 5. 

A change on the number of signals does not modify any of the conclusions above. In 
the same way, the important features of the fundamental diagram are not sensible to the 
independent variation of T 8 and Tc, but only to the variation of the relation Tg/Tc. So 
this is the principal parameter on which the CA will depend. To study this dependence, 
we define the variables qM, the maximum value of the flux; PM, which is the mean 
between the values of p at the two points of maximum flux; and UM = qM/PM, which 
is the mean maximum velocity of the system. In Fig. 7 we see the relation between

5. Conclusion 

The question for the interpretation of the shape of the fundamental diagram can now 
be answered in the following way: the "reverse A" and discontinuous forms are not 

plausible in the case of freeway traffic; the continuous and continuous differentiable 
form will occur with a non-zero p, while the "inverse V" form will happen if p = 0. 

An interesting point to be stressed is that in the analysis of experimental data the value 
of p can be discovered if we restrict ourselves to the limits of high and low densities 

(using the expressions (6) and (7),  and admitting a calibration for the experimental 

diagrams such as that done in Ref. [7] ) and so avoiding the troublesome intermediary 

region where the spreading of points does not allow a precise conclusion. 

As p is associated to an aleatory braking that is not caused by the presence of a car 

ahead, we can imagine that this factor would be related to the dirigibility conditions of 

the roads. So, for good freeways, p would be null and we would have a more adequate 

description for the flux-density relation by an "inverse V" form. 

Also the question for the interpretation of the non-functional relation between flux 

and density in the case of signalized traffic would be answered by the existence of 

two distinct curves for the same system. This seems not to have been obtained by any 

theoretical model until now. 
So, our results seem to be qualitatively in accordance with the known experimental 

data, clarifying some intriguing points in traffic research.
