We present an empirical phase diagram of the congested traffic flow measured on a highway
section with one effective on-ramp. Through the analysis of local density-flow relations and global
spatial structure of the congested region, four distinct congested traffic states are identified. These
states appear at different levels of the upstream flux and the on-ramp flux, thereby generating a
phase digram of the congested traffic flow. Observed traffic states are discussed in connection with
recent theoretical analyses.

Rich physical phenomena in traffic flow have been
investigated by both empirical and theoretical studies.
Two distinct traffic states, the free flow and the traffic
jam state, have been identified from measurements on ho-
mogeneous highways [1] and various properties of them
have been successfully reproduced by traffic models [2].
Further empirical studies [3,4] have reported the pres-

ence of additional traffic states, where typical vehicle ve-
locities take intermediate values between the velocity lev-
els of the free flow and the traffic jam. In these states,
vehicle motions in all lanes are synchronized and the no-
tion of a unique density-flow relation breaks down. From
local traffic patterns, three different types are classified
[3]. These congested traffic states [5] appear mostly near
ramps and theoretical studies [6,7] of the ramp effects
reproduced some of their features such as the discontin-
uous transition from the free flow to the congested flow
and the high flux level of the congested flow.
Recently, more extensive theoretical studies [8,9] have

revealed that for highways with an on-ramp, several dis-
tinct congested traffic states appear depending on the
levels of the upstream flux and the on-ramp flux. A phase
diagram is constructed [8,9] and metastabilities between
these states are also investigated [9]. Yet the relation be-
tween these studies and the observations [3,4] is not clear
and especially no empirical evidence for the predicted
phase diagram has been reported to our knowledge.
In this Letter, we present an analysis of the congested

traffic flow measured on a highway in Seoul, Korea. From
the studies of the traffic patterns at fixed locations and
the global spatial structures, we find 4 qualitatively dis-
tinct congested traffic states. Appearance of each state
depends on the upstream flux and the on-ramp flux, from
which we construct the empirical phase diagram. These 4
states exhibit features that agree with theoretical studies
[8,9]. But differences are also discovered.
For the study, we use the traffic data of the Olympic

Highway which connects the east and west ends of Seoul.
Since it is an intra-city highway, there are many ramps
and the spacings between them are rather short (∼ 1 km).
But in some sections, lane dividers separate the lane 1
and 2 from the lane 3 and 4, and as a result, the two in-
ner lanes become a ramp-free highway. Our investigation

is focused on a 14 km east-bound section, between Seoul
bridge and Young-dong bridge, that contains a long (≈ 5
km) lane divider [10]. In this section, 6 on-ramps and 6
off-ramps exist (all of them connected to the outermost
lane 4) and 15 image detectors record the flux q and the
average velocity v for each lane at every one minute in-
terval [Fig. 1(a)]. Among the ramps located outside the
ideal ramp-free region, usually only one or two of them
are effective and the flux through other ramps are small.
For the analysis, inner-lane traffic data for 14 different
days in June and July, 1998 are used. We search con-
gested traffic states that are long-lived (∼ 1 hour) and
appear practically everyday. In this way, we identify 4
congested traffic states, for each of which, data for a par-
ticular day are presented below to demonstrate its typical
features.
The first kind of the congested traffic states, which we

call CT1, is shown in Fig. 1(b), where the on-ramp ON3
at x = 8.6 km is the main ramp in the time interval de-
picted in the figure and the traffic between x ≈ 3 km
and x ≈ 10 km is congested. The spatial extension of
the congested region does not expand with time (within
our estimated accuracy of 1 km/h) but the boundaries
of the region are not stationary. Also systematic oscil-
lation develops spontaneously near the upstream bound-
ary, which is manifest in the velocity vs. time plot at D4
[Fig. 1(c)]. Notice that the velocity oscillation is ampli-
fied and its period is enhanced as the upstream boundary
is approached. Peaks of the velocity move with velocity
∼ −13 km/h. Similar features are reported in Ref. [11].
We mention that the oscillation is not caused by the tem-
poral variations in the upstream flux. Another charater-
istic of the CT1 state is the two-dimensional covering of
the density-flow relation [Fig. 1(d)].
The second kind of the congested traffic states, CT2,

is shown in Fig. 2(a), where the effective ramp is ON3.
The density-flow relations cover two-dimensional areas
[Fig. 2(b)]. In contrast to the CT1 state, however, the
boundaries of the congested region are almost motionless
and the development of the large amplitude oscillation is
not observed [Fig. 2(c)] even though the velocity levels
are comparable to those in the congested region of the
CT1 state.

1




The third kind of the congested traffic states, CT3, is
shown in Fig. 3(a), where the effective ramp is ON4. The
boundaries of the congested region are again motionless.
The congested region is much shorter compared to the
CT1 and CT2 states. More important difference appears
in Fig. 3(b). The density-flow relation at each detector
location inside the congested region forms a straight line,
implying that the velocity (v = q/ρ) remains almost con-
stant even under the significant flux fluctuations. How-
ever the values of the velocity are different for different
detectors. [In 3 out of 14 investigated days, we also ob-
serve a wide congested region (∼ 4 km) with the station-
ary and almost homogeneous velocity profile. Here we do
not present this as another distinct traffic state since the
number of available data sets is too small.]
The fourth and the last kind of the congested traf-

fic states, CT4, is shown in Fig. 4, which appears dur-
ing morning rush hours. The effective ramp is ON3.
While the downstream boundary of the congested region
remains stationary, the upstream boundary propagates
backwards and the congested region expands monotoni-
cally, unlike all other congested traffic states mentioned
above. The expansion rate is higher for the higher level
of the flux in the upstream region where the free flow
is maintained, and the observed values of the rate range
from 2.2 km/h to 8.8 km/h. The density-flow relation
covers a two-dimensional area and the development of
the large amplitude oscillation is not observed.
We examine differences in the appearance conditions of

the 4 congested traffic states. Recent theoretical studies
using one lane models [8,9] suggest that the flux level fup
at the right upstream of the congested region, where the
free flow is maintained, and the on-ramp flux frmp are
the two important control parameters. These studies as-
sume an ideal situation where fup and frmp are constants.
While they fluctuate in reality, however, dominant fluctu-
ations come from short time scale (one minute) variations
and the fluctuations are greatly suppressed in long time
scale (ten minutes or longer). Thus we use the average
values of fup and frmp over the time intervals (typically 1
hour long) during which a particular state is maintained
[12]. In Fig. 5, each point (frmp, fup) thus obtained is
marked with a different symbol depending on the main-
tained congested traffic state. Notice that although there
are some overlaps, each symbol occupies a clearly distin-
guishable region in the frmp-fup plane. This difference
in the data locations verifies the roles of frmp and fup as
important control parameters, in agreement with Refs.
[8,9]. Also the metastability between the free flow and
the CT1, CT2, CT3 states is observed as studied in Ref.
[9].
We now make a detailed comparison of the measure-

ment data with the theoretical studies [8,9]. The CT1
state is similar to the recurring hump (RH) state in Refs.
[6,9]. In both states, the congested regions do not ex-
pand and systematic oscillations develop. The oscillation
in the CT1 state, however, exhibits features that are not
shared by the RH state, such as the oscillation amplifi-

cation and the period enhancement [13]. The CT2 state
can be related to the pinned localized cluster (PLC) state
[8,9] [in Ref. [9], a different term “standing localized clus-
ter” (SLC) state is used to denote the same state]. In
both states, the congested region does not expand and
no systematic oscillation develops. Also the spatial vari-
ation of the long time (∼ 1 hour) averaged density-flow
relations from the upstream to the downstream is essen-
tially identical to the pattern for the PLC state [Fig. 2(b)
in Ref. [9]]. And the data locations of the CT2 state in
the frmp-fup plane [Fig. 5] are to the left of those of the
CT1 state, which agrees with the relationship between
the PLC and the RH state [9]. The two-dimensional
covering of the density-flow plane in the CT1 and CT2
states, on the other hand, is not shared by the RH and
PLC states. We speculate that the covering property
may be due to fluctuations effects that are not taken
into account in Refs. [8,9]. For example, it is recently
demonstrated that fluctuations in vehicle types can gen-
erate the two-dimensional covering [14]. We also suspect
that short time scale fluctuations in fup and frmp may
generate a similar effect.
The CT3 state is also similar to the predicted PLC

state in regard to the stationary boundaries of the con-
gested region and the absence of the systematic oscil-
lations. The data locations of the state in the fup-frmp
plane [Fig. 5] are also in reasonable agreement with those
of the PLC state [8,9]. However the property of the con-
stant velocity in this state is not shared by the PLC state.
This property implies that the car following dynamics in
this state is significantly different from that assumed in
many theoretical models [2,7], that is, the velocity ad-
justment to the spatial gap.
The CT4 state can be related to the oscillating con-

gested traffic (OCT) state or homogeneous congested
traffic (HCT) state [8,9], both of which exhibit the ex-
pansion of the congested region to the upstream. In the-
oretical studies, it is found that the congested region of
the OCT state contains large clusters with the jam char-
acter while the congested region of the HCT state is ho-
mogeneous [8,9]. The density-flow relation of the CT4
state does not demonstrate the characteristic line of the
jam, which suggests that the HCT state is the proper
theoretical counterpart of the CT4 state. As for the two-
dimensional covering property of the CT4 state, we men-
tion that the same covering can be reproduced for the
HCT state [14]. Also the data locations of the CT4 state
in the phase diagram are consistent with the prediction
for the HCT state.
We next compare our data with the German highway

data in Ref. [3], where congested traffic flows are classified
into 3 types (i,ii,iii) according to local density-flow rela-
tions without much regard to spatial structures. In this
classification, the CT1, CT2, and CT4 states with non-
stationary density-flow relations belong to the type (iii),
and the CT3 state with the stationary velocity property
to the type (ii). We also observe the type (i) state that is
characterized by the stationary velocity and density pro-

2



files. However, this state is always short-lived (less than
5 minutes), which is too short for our analysis, and we
do not include this state in our classification.

It is also interesting to compare the CT1 state with the
congested traffic state reported in Ref. [11], which we call
CT1’ state tentatively. In both states, the amplification
and the periodicity enhancement of the velocity oscilla-
tion occur and the average velocity levels rise during the
amplification. On the other hand, the velocity oscillation
in the CT1’ state grows to generate mature jam clusters
and the density-flow relation approaches the characteris-
tic line (the line J in Ref. [11]) of the traffic jam, while
this feature is absent in the CT1 state [see Fig. 1(d)].
This difference suggests that the CT1 and CT1’ states
may be distinct congested traffic states. They also seem
to appear at different regions in the frmp-fup plane. From
the data give in Ref. [11], we estimate fup ≥ 1600 veh/h
(information for frmp is not available) for the CT1’ state
(compare with Fig. 5). A recent study [15] also suggests
that the CT1’ state is related rather to the theoretically
predicted OCT state [8,9], instead of the RH state.

In summary, 4 congested traffic states are identified
by combining temporal traffic patterns at fixed locations
and spatial structure of the congested region. It is found
that these 4 states appear at different levels of the up-
stream flux and the on-ramp flux. An empirical phase
diagram is constructed and compared with recent pre-
dictions. Many properties of the observed states agree
with predictions but deviations are also found. Lastly
we mention that there exist regions in the frmp-fup plane
which are not probed by our data. Thus it is possible that
additional congested traffic states exist in those regions.
Further investigation is necessary.

[12] Both quantities are averaged over the two inner lanes.

And frmp is estimated from the difference between the
maximum flux level near the downstream end of the con-
gested region and the flux level near the upstream end of
congested region.

[13] A recent theoretical study [15] reproduces the oscillation
amplification and the period enhancement. But in this
study, the congested region expands monotonically with
time, which makes a clear distinction from the CT1 state.
