Abstract. Starting from the instability diagram of a traffic flow model, we derive conditions for the oc-
currence of congested traffic states, their appearance, their spreading in space and time, and the related
increase in travel times. We discuss the terminology of traffic phases and give empirical evidence for the
existence of a phase diagram of traffic states. In contrast to previously presented phase diagrams, it is
shown that “widening synchronized patterns” are possible, if the maximum flow is located inside of a
metastable density regime. Moreover, for various kinds of traffic models with different instability diagrams
it is discussed, how the related phase diagrams are expected to approximately look like. Apart from this,
it is pointed out that combinations of on- and off-ramps create different patterns than a single, isolated
on-ramp.

1 Introduction

While traffic science makes a clear distinction between
free and congested traffic, the empirical analysis of spa-
tiotemporal congestion patterns has recently revealed an
unexpected complexity of traffic states. Early contribu-
tions in traffic physics focussed on the study of so-called
“phantom traffic jams” [1], i.e. traffic jams resulting from
minor perturbations in the traffic flow rather than from
accidents, building sites, or other bottlenecks. This sub-
ject has recently been revived due to new technologies
facilitating experimental traffic research [2]. Related the-
oretical and numerical stability analyses were – and still
are – often carried out for setups with periodic boundary
conditions. This is, of course, quite artificial, as compared
to real traffic situations. Therefore, in response to em-
pirical findings [3], physicists have pointed out that the
occurrence of congested traffic on real freeways normally
results from a combination of three ingredients [4,5]:

1. a high traffic volume (defined as the freeway flow plus
the actual on-ramp flow, see below),

2. a spatial inhomogeneity of the freeway (such as a ramp,
gradient, or change in the number of usable lanes), and

3. a temporary perturbation of the traffic flow (e.g. due to
lane changes [6] or long-lasting overtaking maneuvers
of trucks [7,8]).

The challenge of traffic modeling, however, goes consid-
erably beyond this. It would be favorable, if the traffic
dynamics could be understood on the basis of elementary

traffic patterns [7] such as the ones depicted in Fig. 1, and
if complex traffic patterns (see, e.g., Fig. 2) could be un-
derstood as combinations of them, considering interaction
effects.

It was proposed that the occurrence of elementary con-
gested traffic states could be classified and predicted by a
phase diagram [4,10]. Furthermore, it was suggested that
this phase diagram can be derived from the instability dia-
gram of traffic flow and the outflow from congested traffic.
This idea has been taken up in many other publications,
also as a means of studying, visualizing, and classifying
properties of traffic models [11,12,13,14]. However, it has
been claimed that the phase diagram approach would be
insufficient [15]. While some of the criticism is due to mis-
understandings, as will be shown in Sec. 7.1, the classical
phase diagrams lack, in fact, the possibility of “widening
synchronized patterns” (WSP) proposed by Kerner and
Klenov [16], see Fig. 1(d).

In this paper, we will start in Sec. 2 with a discussion
of the somewhat controversial notion of “traffic phases”
and the clarification that we use it to distinguish conges-
tion patterns with a qualitatively different spatiotemporal
appearance. In Sec. 3 we will show that existing mod-
els can produce all the empirically observed patterns of
Fig. 1, when simulated in an open system with a bottle-
neck. We will then present a derivation and explanation
of the idealized, schematic phase diagram of traffic states
in Sec. 4. In contrast to previous publications, we will
assume that the critical density ρc2, at which traffic be-

comes linearly unstable, is greater than the density ρmax,
where the maximum flow is reached (see Appendix A for
details). As a consequence, we will find that “widening
synchronized pattern” do exist within the phase diagram
approach, even for models with a fundamental diagram.
While this analysis is carried out for single, isolated bot-
tlenecks, Sec. 5 will introduce how to generalize it to the
case of multi-ramp setups. In Sec. 6, we will discuss other
possible types of phase diagrams, depending on the sta-
bility properties of the considered model. Afterwards, in
Sec. 7, we will present recent empirical data supporting
our theoretical phase diagram. Sections 7.1 and 8 will fi-
nally try to overcome some misunderstandings regarding
the phase diagram concept and summarize our findings.

2 On the Definition of Traffic Phases

Before we present the phase diagram of traffic states, it
must be emphasized that some confusion arises from the
different use of the term “(traffic) phase”. In thermody-
namics, a “phase” corresponds to an equilibrium state in a
region of the parameter space of thermodynamic variables
(such as pressure and temperature), in which the appro-
priate free energy is analytic, i.e., all first and higher-order

derivatives with respect to the thermodynamic variables
exist. One speaks of a first-order phase transition, if a first
derivative, or “order parameter”, is discontinuous, and of
a “second-order” or “continuous” phase transition, if the
first derivatives are continuous but a second derivative
(the “susceptibility”) diverges. What consequences does
this have for defining “traffic phases”?

Although traffic flow is a self-driven nonequilibrium
system, it has been shown [17] that much of the equi-
librium concepts can be transferred to driven or self-
driven non-equilibrium systems by appropriately redefin-
ing them. Furthermore, concepts of classical thermody-
namics have been successfully applied to nonequilibrium
physical and nonphysical systems, yielding quantitatively
correct results. This includes, for example, the application
of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [18] (originally re-
ferring to equilibrium phenomena) to vehicular traffic [19].

In contrast to classical thermodynamics, nonequilib-
rium phase transitions are possible in one-dimensional sys-
tems [20]. However, according to the definition of phase
transitions, one needs to make sure that details of the
boundary conditions or finite-size effects do not play a
role for the characteristic properties of the phase. Fur-
thermore, one must define suitable order parameters or
susceptibilities. While the first propositions have been al-

Fig. 2. Two examples of complex traffic states measured on the
German freeway A5 close to Frankfurt. Top: On the A5 North,
an accident occurs at x = 487.5 km at the time t = 17:13 h,
which causes a HCT pattern that turns into an OCT pattern
as the upstream traffic flow goes down. The capacity drop re-
lated to the congestion pattern reduces the downstream flow
and leads to a dissolution of the previous SGW pattern over
there around t = 18:00 h. Bottom: On the freeway A5 South,
the stop-and-go waves induced by a bottleneck at x = 480 km
replace the OCT at the bottleneck near x = 470 km. At time
t = 9:50 h, the waves induce an accident at x = 478.33 km,
which triggers a new OCT pattern further upstream. The re-
lated capacity drop, in turn, causes the previous OCT state at
x ≈ 480 km to dissolve.

ready made a decade ago [21], there is no general agree-
ment regarding the quantity that should be chosen for
the order parameter. Candidates include the density, the
fraction of vehicles in the congested state [21], the aver-
age velocity or flow, or the variance of density, velocity, or
flow. Whenever one observes a discontinuous or hysteretic
transition in a large enough system, there is no need to
define an order parameter, as this already implies a first-
order phase transition. For continuous, symmetry-braking
phase transitions, the deviation from the more symmetric
state (e.g. the amplitude of density variations as compared
to the homogeneous state) seems to be an appropriate or-
der parameter.

To summarize the above points, it appears that ther-
modynamic phases can, in fact, be defined for traffic flow.
In connection with transitions between different traffic
states at bottlenecks, we particularly mention the notion

of boundary-induced phase transitions [22,23,24]. Here, the
boundary conditions have been mainly used as a means to
control the average density in the open system under con-
sideration.

In publications on traffic, a “phase” is often inter-
preted as “traffic pattern” or “traffic state with a typical
spatio-temporal appearance”. Such states depend on the
respective boundary conditions. In this way, models with
several phases can produce a multitude of spatiotempo-
ral patterns. It should become clear from these consid-
erations that the various proposed “phase diagrams” do
not relate to thermodynamic phases, but classify spatio-
temporal states, as is common in systems theory. In these
non-thermodynamic phase diagrams, the “phase space” is
spanned by certain control parameters, e.g. by suitably
parameterized boundary conditions, by inhomogeneities
(bottleneck strengths), or by model parameters [25]. For
example, the phase diagrams discussed in Refs. [4,15] and
this paper contain the axes “main inflow” (i.e., an up-
stream boundary condition) and “on-ramp flow” (charac-
terizing the bottleneck strength).

In any case, empirical observations of the traffic dy-
namics relate to the spatiotemporal traffic patterns, and
not to the thermodynamic phases. Therefore, the quality
of a traffic model should be assessed by asking whether it
can produce all observed kinds of spatio-temporal traffic
patterns, including the conditions for their appearance.

3 Congested Traffic States

When simulating traffic flow with the “microscopic” in-
telligent driver model (IDM) [10], the optimal veloc-
ity model (OVM) [26], the non-local, gas-kinetic-based
traffic model (GKT) [27], or the “macroscopic” Kerner-
Konha¨user model [28] (with the parameter set chosen by
Lee et al. [29]), we find free traffic flow and different kinds
of congestion patterns, when the ramp flow Qon and the
upstream arrival flow Qup on the freeway are varied. The
diversity of traffic patterns is

1. due to the possibility of having either locally constraint
or spatially extended congestion1 and

2. due to the possibility of having stable, unstable or free
traffic flows.

Typical representatives of congested traffic patterns ob-
tained by computer simulations with the intelligent driver
model [10] are shown in Fig. 3. Notice that all empirical
patterns displayed in Fig. 1 can be reproduced.

One can distinguish the different traffic states (i.e. con-
gestion patterns) by analyzing the temporal and spatial

1 Note that traffic patterns which appear to be localized, but
continue to grow in size, belong to the spatially extended cat-
egory of traffic states. Therefore, “widening moving clusters”
(WMC) are classified as extended congested traffic, while the
similarly looking “moving localized clusters” (MLC) are not.
According to Fig. 6, however, the phases of both states are lo-
cated next to each other, so one could summarize both phases
by one area representing “moving clusters” (MC).

Fig. 3. Simulation of traffic on a freeway with an on-ramp at location x = 0 km using the intelligent driver model (IDM) [10]
with parameters corresponding to an instability diagram as illustrated in Fig. 4(d). The macroscopic velocity field was extracted
from the simulated trajectories by placing virtual detectors every 500m and determining the velocity with the same method [9]
that has been used for the data. Depending on the respective traffic flows on the ramp and on the freeway, different kinds
of congested traffic states emerge: a moving cluster (MC), a pinned localized cluster (PLC), (“triggered”) stop-and-go waves
(SGW), oscillating congested traffic (OCT), or homogeneous congested traffic (HCT). During the first minutes of the simulation,
the flows on the freeway and the on-ramp were increased from low values to their final values. Since the assumed flows fall into
a metastable traffic regime, the actual breakdown was initiated by additional perturbations of the ramp flow.

dependence of the average velocity V (x, t): If V (x, t) stays
above a certain threshold Vcrit, where x is varied within
a homogeneous freeway section upstream of a bottleneck,
we call the traffic state free traffic (FT), otherwise con-
gested traffic.2 If these speeds fall below Vcrit only over a
short freeway subsection, and the length of this section is
approximately stable or stabilizes over time, we talk about
localized clusters (LC), otherwise of spatially extended con-
gestion states (see also footnote 1).

According to our simulations, there are two forms of
localized clusters: Pinned localized clusters (PLC) stay
at a fixed location over a longer period of time, while
moving localized clusters (MLC) propagate upstream with
the characteristic speed c0. These states have to be
contrasted with extended congested traffic3: Stop-and-go
waves (SGW) may be interpreted as a sequence of sev-
eral moving localized clusters. Alternatively, they may
be viewed as special case of oscillating congested traffic
(OCT), but with free traffic flows of about Qout & 1800

80 km/h.

and footnote 1)

vehicles/h/lane between the upstream propagating jams.
Generally, however, OCT is just characterized by oscil-
lating speeds in the congested range, i.e. unstable traffic
flows. If the speeds are congested over a spatially extended
area, but not oscillating,4 we call this homogeneous con-
gested traffic (HCT). It is typically related with low vehicle
velocities.

In summary, besides free traffic, the above mentioned
and some other traffic models predict five different, spatio-
temporal patterns of congested traffic states at a sim-
ple on-ramp bottleneck: PLC, MLC, SGW, OCT, and
HCT. Similar traffic states have been identified for flow-
conserving bottlenecks in car-following models [30,31], and
for on-ramps and other types of bottlenecks in macro-
scopic models [4,29].

In contrast to this past work, we have also simulated
an additional traffic pattern [Fig. 3(d)]. This pattern has
a similarity to the widening synchronized pattern (WSP)
proposed by Kerner in the framework of his three-phase
traffic theory [32]. In the following section, we show how

in real vehicle traffic

this pattern may be understood in the framework of mod-
els with a fundamental diagram.

4 Derivation and Explanation of the Phase
Diagram of Traffic States

It turns out that the possible traffic patterns in open sys-
tems with bottlenecks are mainly determined by the in-
stability diagram (see Fig. 4), no matter if the model is
macroscopic or microscopic. This seems to apply at least
for traffic models with a fundamental diagram, which we
will focus on in the following sections. Due to the close re-
lationship with the instability diagram, the preconditions
for the possible occurrence of the different traffic states
can be illustrated by a phase diagram. Figures 5 and 6
show two examples. Each area of a phase diagram rep-
resents the combinations of upstream freeway flows Qup
and bottleneck strengths ∆Q, for which a certain kind of
traffic state can exist.

It is obvious that an on-ramp flow Qon(t), for example,
causes a bottleneck, as it consumes some of the capacity
of the freeway. Qon(t) represents the flow actually entering
the freeway via the on-ramp, i.e. the flow leaving the on-
ramp and not the flow entering the on-ramp.5 We assume
that Qon(t) is known through a suitable measurement.
Having clarified this, we define the bottleneck strength due
to an on-ramp by the entering ramp flow, divided by the
number Ifr of freeway lanes:

∆Q(t) = ∆Qon(t) =
Qon(t)

Ifr
. (1)

This is done so, because the average flow ∆Q added to
each freeway lane by the on-ramp flow corresponds to the
capacity that is not available anymore for the traffic flow
Qup coming from the upstream freeway section. As a con-
sequence, congestion may form upstream of the ramp. In
the following, we will have to determine the density inside
the forming congestion pattern and where in the insta-
bility diagram it is located. It will turn out that, given
certain values of Qup and ∆Q, the different regions of the
phase diagram can be related with the respectively ob-
served or simulated spatiotemporal patterns. We distin-
guish free traffic and different kinds of localized congested
traffic as well as different kinds of extended congested traf-
fic. When contrasting our classification of traffic states
with Kerner’s one [15], we find the following comparison
helpful:

1. According to our understanding, what we call “ex-
tended congested traffic” may be associated with
Kerner’s “synchronized flow”. In particular, the area

5 When the freeway is busy, it may happen that these two
flows are different and that a queue of vehicles forms on the
on-ramp. Of course, it is an interesting question to determine
how the entering ramp flow depends on the freeway flow, but
this is not the focus of attention here, as this formula is not
required for the following considerations.

where Kerner’s phase diagrams predict a “general pat-
tern” matches well with the area, where we expect
OCT and HCT states.

2. “Moving clusters”6 may be associated with “wide
moving jams” and/or “moving synchronized patterns”
(MSP).

3. “Stop-and-go waves” appear to be related with mul-
tiple “wide moving jams” generated by the “pinch ef-
fect”.

4. “Pinned localized clusters” may related to Kerner’s
“localized synchronized pattern” (LSP).

5. Kerner’s “widening synchronized pattern” (WSP) and
“dissolving general pattern” (DGP) did not have a cor-
respondence with results of our own computer simula-
tions so far. These states are predicted to appear for
high freeway flows and low bottleneck strengths. In the
following subsections, we report that, quite unexpect-
edly, similar results are found for certain traffic models
having a fundamental diagram.

The phase diagram can not only be determined numeri-
cally. It turns out that the borderlines between different
areas (the so-called phase boundaries) can also be theoret-
ically understood, based on the flows

Qck = Qe(ρck) (2)

at the instability thresholds ρck (k = 1, . . . , 4), the maxi-
mum flow capacity Qmax under free flow conditions, and
the dynamic flow capacity, i.e. the characteristic outflow
Qout from congested traffic [33] (see Fig. 4). Qe(ρ) rep-
resents the equilibrium flow-density relationship, which is
also called the “fundamental diagram”.

The exact shape and location of the separation lines
between different kinds of traffic states depend on the
traffic model and its parameter values.7 Furthermore, the
characteristic outflow Qout typically depends on the type
and strength of the bottleneck.8 For the sake of simplic-
ity of our discussion, however, we will assume constant
outflows Qout in the following.

The meaning of the different critical density thresholds
ρck and flow thresholds Qck = Qe(ρck), respectively, is de-
scribed in the caption of Fig. 4. Note that the density ρc2
may be smaller or larger than the density ρmax at capac-
ity, where the maximum flow Qmax is reached. Previous
computer simulations and phase diagrams mostly assumed
parameters where traffic at capacity is linearly unstable
(ρc2 < ρmax < ρc3), which is depicted in Figs. 4(a) and
(b). However, in some traffic models such as the IDM [10],
the stability thresholds can be controlled in a flexible way

6 i.e. “moving localized clusters” (MLC) and “widening mov-
ing clusters” (WMC), see footnote 1 and Sec. 4.2
7 Since the model parameters characterize the prevailing

driving style as well as external conditions such as weather con-
ditions and speed limits, the separation lines (“phase bound-
aries”) and even the existence of certain traffic patterns are
subject to these factors, see Sec. 7.
8 For example, in most models, the outflow Qout down-

stream of an on-ramp bottleneck decreases with the bottleneck
strength and increases with the length of the on-ramp [10,35].

Fig. 4. Illustration of stable, linearly unstable, and metastable
density regimes within velocity-density diagrams Ve(ρ) (top)
and the flow-density diagrams Qe(ρ) (bottom). Traffic is sta-
ble for ρ < ρc1 and ρ > ρc4 and linearly unstable for ρc2 <
ρ < ρc3. These two regimes are separated by a low-density and
a high-density region of metastable traffic given by the inter-
vals ρc1 < ρ < ρc2 and ρc3 < ρ < ρc4, respectively. In the
metastable regimes, perturbations in the traffic flow grow, if
their size is larger than a certain critical amplitude [34], other-
wise they fade away. The critical amplitude is largest towards
the boundaries ρc1 and ρc4 of unconditionally stable traffic
flow, while it goes to zero towards the boundaries ρc2 and ρc3
of linearly unstable traffic. Note that the metastable and unsta-
ble regimes may vanish for certain traffic models or parameter
specifications. The possible types of congested traffic patterns
depend on the existence of the different stability regimes and
on the relative position of their boundaries with respect to the
density ρmax at capacity Qmax (maximum flow). The left fig-
ures show the situation for ρc2 < ρmax, the right figures the
situation for ρc2 > ρmax.

by varying their model parameters (see Appendix B). In
the following, we will focus on the case where traffic at
capacity is metastable (ρc2 > ρmax > ρc1), cf. Fig. 4(c)
and (d).9 As will be shown in the next subsection, this
appears to offer an alternative explanation of the “widen-
ing synchronized pattern” (WSP) introduced in Ref. [32],
see Fig. 3(d). Simpler cases will be addressed in Sec. 6
below.

4.1 Transition to Congested Traffic for Small
Bottlenecks

In the following, we restrict our considerations to situa-
tions with one bottleneck only, namely a single on-ramp.
Combinations of off- and on-ramps are not covered by this
section. They will be treated later on (see Sec. 5).

2,
and b = 1.3m/s2. To generate plots (c) and (d), the accelera-
tion parameter was increased to a = 1.3m/s2, while the other
parameters were left unchanged.

Fig. 6. Schematic phase diagram as in Fig. 5, but for the insta-
bility diagram represented by Figs. 4(c) and (d). In contrast to
Fig. 5, traffic flow at capacity is metastable (ρc1 < ρmax < ρc2),
which leads to a greater variety of traffic states in the upper left
corner of the phase diagram. In particularly, we find “widen-
ing synchronized patterns” (WSP). “OCT, SGW” means that
one expects to find oscillating congested traffic or stop-and-
go waves, but not necessarily both. Together with “widening
moving clusters” (WMC, see footnote 1) they form the area
of extended oscillatory congestion. However, the WMC and
MLC phases may also be summarized by one area represent-
ing “moving clusters” (MC).

For matters of illustration, we assume a typical rush
hour scenario, in which the total traffic volume

Qtot(t) = Qup(t) +∆Q(t) , (3)

i.e. the sum of the flow Qup(t) sufficiently upstream of the
ramp bottleneck and the on-ramp flow ∆Q(t) per freeway
lane, is increasing with time t. As long as traffic flows
freely, the flow downstream of the bottleneck corresponds
to the total flowQtot(t), while the upstream flow is Qup(t).



D. Helbing, M. Treiber, A. Kesting and M. Scho¨nhof: Classification and Prediction of Congested Traffic States 7

When the total flow Qtot(t) exceeds the critical density
ρc1, it enters the metastable density regime. That is, large
enough perturbations may potentially grow and cause a
breakdown of the traffic flow. However, often the pertur-
bations remain comparatively small, and the total traffic
volume rises so quickly that it eventually exceeds the max-
imum freeway capacity

Qtot = Qup+∆Q > Qmax = max
ρ

Qe(ρ) = Qe(ρmax) . (4)

This is reflected in the left phase diagram in Fig. 6 by
the diagonal line separating the states “FT” and “WSP”.
(Note that ρmax represents the density, for which the max-
imum free traffic flow occurs, not the jam density ρjam.)

When the total traffic volume Qtot exceeds the max-
imum capacity Qmax, a platoon of vehicles will form up-
stream of the bottleneck. Since, in this section, we as-
sume metastable traffic at maximum capacity Qmax (see
Fig. 7 in Ref. [8]), this will not instantaneously lead to a
traffic breakdown with an associated capacity drop. Thus,
the flow downstream of the bottleneck remains limited to
Qmax (at least temporarily). As the on-ramp flow takes
away an amount ∆Q of the maximum capacity Qmax, the
(maximum) flow upstream of the bottleneck is given by

Qbot = Qmax −∆Q . (5)

When the actual upstream flow Qup exceeds this value, a
mild form of congestion will result upstream of the ramp.
The density of the forming vehicle platoon is predicted to
be

ρbot = ρcg(Qbot) = ρcg
(
Qmax −∆Q

)
> ρmax , (6)

where ρcg(Q) is the density corresponding to a stationary
and homogeneous congested flow of value Q (i.e. it is the
inverse function of the “congested branch” of the funda-
mental diagram).

According to the equation for the propagation speed
of shockwaves (see Ref. [36]), the upstream front of the
forming vehicle platoon is expected to propagate upstream
at the speed

C1(t) =
Qup −Qbot

ρfr(Qup)− ρcg(Qbot)
, (7)

where ρfr(Q) is the density of stationary and homogeneous
traffic at a given flow Q (i.e. the inverse function of the
“free branch” of the fundamental diagram.)

Note that this high-flow situation can persist for a sig-
nificant time period only, if the flow Qbot in the platoon is
stable or metastable. This is the case if one of the following
applies:

(i) The traffic flow is unconditionally stable for all densi-
ties such as in the Lighthill-Whitham model [37]. This
will be discussed in Sec. 6 below.

(ii) Traffic flow at capacity is metastable and the bottle-
neck is sufficiently weak. This gives rise to the widening
synchronized pattern (WSP), as will be discussed in the
rest of this subsection.

By WSP, we mean a semi-congested extending traffic
state without large-scale oscillations or significant velocity
drops below, say, 30-40km/h [15]. Putting aside stochas-
tic accelerations or heterogeneous driver-vehicle popula-
tions, this corresponds to (meta-)stable vehicle platoons
at densities greater than, but close to the density ρmax at
capacity. This can occur when ρbot lies in the metastable
density range, i.e. ρmax < ρbot < ρc2, corresponding to
Qmax > Qbot = Qmax −∆Q > Qc2 or

∆Q < Qmax −Qc2. (8)
In Fig. 6, this condition belongs to the area left of the
vertical line separating the WSP and OCT states. If the
bottleneck strength∆Q becomes greater than Qmax−Qc2,
or if ρcg(Qbot) lies in the metastable regime and pertur-
bations in the traffic flow are large enough, traffic flow
becomes unstable and breaks down. After the related ca-
pacity drop by the amount

∆Qdrop = Qmax −Qout , (9)
the new, “dynamic” capacity will be given by the outflow
Qout from congested traffic [10]. Obviously, the capacity
drop causes the formation of more serious congestion10.
This is illustrated in the right phase diagram of Fig. 6 by
the offset between the diagonal lines separating free traffic
fromWSP and the other extended congested states (OCT,
SGW, and HCT). In the following, we will focus on the
traffic states after the breakdown of freeway capacity from
Qmax to Qout has taken place.

4.2 Conditions for Different Kinds of Congested
Traffic after the Breakdown of Traffic Flow

For the sake of simplicity, we will assume the case

Qc4 < Qc3 < Qc1 ≤ Qout ≤ Qc2 < Qmax , (10)
which seems to be appropriate for real traffic (particularly
in Germany). However, depending on the choice of model
parameters, other cases are possible. The conclusions may
be different, then, but the line of argumentation is the
same. In the following, we will again assume ρc2 ≥ ρmax,
so that the maximum flow Qmax is metastable. Therefore,
it can persist for some time, until the maximum flow state
is destabilized by perturbations or too high traffic vol-
umes Qtot(t), which eventually cause a breakdown of the
traffic flow. (For ρc2 < ρmax, the capacity drop happens
automatically, whenever Qtot(t) > Qmax.)

After the breakdown of traffic flow, the traffic situation
downstream is given by the outflow Qout from (seriously)
congested traffic. As the actually entering ramp flow re-
quires the capacity ∆Q per lane, the flow upstream of the
bottleneck is limited to

Qcong = Qout −∆Q . (11)
10 and the condition Qup + ∆Q < Qout for the gradual dis-
solution of the resulting congestion pattern is harder to fulfil
than the condition Qup +∆Q < Qmax implied by Eq. (4)

Fig. 7. Examples of congestion patterns on the German freeway A5 close to Frankfurt, for which data have been provided
to the authors between kilometers 465 and 492. The figures analyze the propagation of the upstream front of a region of
congested traffic (white solid line) according to Eq. (12), for empirical HCT (left) and OCT (right). In both plots, the driving
direction is upwards (as indicated by the arrows). The upstream flow Qup was determined from a detector cross section whose
location is indicated by a dotted white line, while the bottleneck flow was determined from detectors of a nearby cross section
(dashed white line). When determining the flows, the time delay caused by the finite propagation velocities dQe(ρ)/dρ from
the detectors to the upstream front was taken care of. The congestion patterns were chosen such that there were no ramps at
or between the two detector cross sections. Otherwise, the determination of Qup and Qcong would have been more complicated.
The free and congested densities were calculated with a simple, triangular fundamental diagram. Therefore, ρfr(Q) = Q/V0 and
ρcg(Q) = ρjam(1−QT ), where the following parameters were chosen: V0 = 120 km/h, ρjam = 100 veh/km/lane, and T = 2 s.

In analogy to Eq. (7), the upstream front of this congested
flow is expected to propagate with the velocity

C2(t) =
Qup −Qcong

ρfr(Qup)− ρcg(Qcong)
, (12)

as the upstream freeway flow Qup is assumed to be free.
The downstream end of the congested flow Qcong remains
located at the bottleneck [38].

Figure 7 shows that the propagation of the upstream
front according to Eq. (12) agrees remarkably well with
empirical observations, not only for homogeneous con-
gested flow but also for the OCT pattern. Since the lo-
cation of the congestion front is given by integration of
Eq. (12) over time, oscillations of the input quantities of
this equation are automatically averaged out.

The resulting congestion pattern depends on the sta-
bility properties of the vehicle density

ρcong = ρcg(Qcong) = ρcg
(
Qout −∆Q

)
(13)

in the congested area, where the outflow Qout from se-
riously congested traffic represents the effective freeway
capacity under congested conditions and ∆Q the capac-
ity taken away by the bottleneck. In view of this stability
dependence, let us now discuss the meaning of the critical
densities ρck or associated flows Qck = Qe(ρck), respec-
tively, for the phase diagram.

If ρc2 < ρcong < ρc3, we expect unstable, oscillatory
traffic flow (OCT or SGW). For ρc3 ≤ ρcong < ρc4, the
congested flow is metastable, i.e. it depends on the per-
turbation amplitude: One may either have oscillatory pat-
terns (for large enough perturbations) or homogeneous

ones (for small perturbations). Moreover, for ρcong ≥ ρc4
(given that the critical density ρc4 is smaller than ρjam),
we expect homogeneous, i.e. non-oscillatory traffic flows.

Expressing this in terms of flows rather than den-
sities, one would expect the following: Oscillatory con-
gestion patterns (OCT or SGW) should be possible for
Qc2 > Qcong = Qout −∆Q > Qc4, i.e. in the range

Qout −Qc2 < ∆Q < Qout −Qc4 , (14)

where we have considered Qc2 ≥ Qout.
The assumption that the densities between ρout with

Qe(ρout) = Qout and Qmax are metastable, as we as-
sume here, has interesting implications: A linear instability
would cause a single moving cluster to trigger further lo-
cal clusters and, thereby, so-called “triggered stop-and-go
waves” (TSG or SGW) [4]. A metastability, in contrast,
can suppress the triggering of additional moving clusters,
which allows the persistence of a single moving cluster, if
the bottleneck strength ∆Q is small. As, for Qtot > Qout,
the related flow conditions fall into the area of extended
congested traffic, the spatial extension of such a cluster
will grow. Therefore, one may use the term “widening
moving cluster” (WMC).

Furthermore, according to our computer simulations,
the capacity downstream of a widening moving cluster
may eventually revert from Qout to Qmax. This happens in
the area, where “widening synchronized patterns” (WSP)
can appear.11 Therefore, rather than by Eq. (14), the bot-

11 In this connection, it is interesting to remember Kerner’s
“dissolving general pattern” (DGP), which is predicted under
similar flow conditions.

tleneck strengths characterizing OCT or SGW states are
actually given by

Qmax −Qc2 < ∆Q < Qout −Qc4 , (15)
where the lower boundary corresponds to the boundary of
the WSP state, see Eq. (8). We point out that a capacity
reversion despite congestion is a special feature of traffic
models with ρc2 > ρmax.

Homogeneous congested traffic (the definition of which
does not cover the homogeneous WSP state) is expected
to be possible for Qcong = Qout −∆Q < Qc3, i.e. (meta-)
stable flows at high densities. This corresponds to

∆Q > Qout −Qc3 . (16)
The occurrence of extended congested traffic like HCT and
OCT requires an additional condition: The total flow must
exceed the freeway capacity Qout during serious conges-
tion,12 i.e. we must have

Qtot = Qup +∆Q > Qout . (17)

Localized congestion patterns, in contrast, require Qtot ≤
Qout and can be triggered for Qtot > Qc1, which implies

Qc1 < Qtot = Qup +∆Q ≤ Qout . (18)
We can distinguish at least two cases: On the one hand, if

Qc1 < Qup < Qmax , (19)

the flow upstream of the congested area is metastable,
which allows jams (and large enough perturbations) to
propagate upstream. In this case, we speak of moving
localized clusters (MLC). Their propagation speed c0 =
−15± 5 km/h is given by the slope of the jam line [39].

On the other hand, if

Qup ≤ Qc1 (20)
or ρfr(Qup) < ρc1, traffic flow upstream of the bottle-
neck is stable. Under such conditions, perturbations and,
in particular, localized congestion patterns cannot propa-
gate upstream, and they stay at the location of the bottle-
neck. In this case, one speaks of pinned localized clusters
(PLC).13

12 One may also analyze the situation with the shock wave
equation: Spatially expanding congested traffic results, if the
speed of the downstream shock front of the congested area
(which is usually zero) minus the speed of the upstream shock
front (which is usually negative) gives a positive value.
13 Since pinned localized clusters rarely constitute a max-
imum perturbation, they can also occur at higher densities
and flows, as long as Qup < Qc2. Therefore, MLC and PLC
states can coexist in the range Qc1 < Qup < Qc2. For most
traffic models and bottleneck types, congestion patterns with
Qtot ≈ Qc1 do not exist, since localized congestion patterns do
not correspond to maximum perturbations. The actual lower
boundary Q˜c1 for the overall traffic volume Qtot that generates
congestion is somewhat higher thanQc1, but usually lower than
Qc2. Considering the metastability of traffic flow in this range
and the decay of the critical perturbation amplitude from ρc1
to ρc2 [34], this behavior is expected. However, for some models
and parameters, one may even have Q˜c1 > Qout. In such cases,
PLC states would not be possible under any circumstances.

We underline that the actual outflow Q˜out from lo-
calized clusters corresponds, of course, to their inflow
Qup+∆Q (otherwise they would grow or shrink in space).

Therefore, the actual outflow Q˜out of localized congestion
patterns can be smaller than Qout, i.e. smaller than the
outflow of serious congestion.

5 Combinations of On- and Off-Ramps

We see that the instability diagram implies a large variety
of congestion patterns already in the simple simulation
scenario of a homogeneous freeway with a single ramp.
The possible congestion patterns are even richer in cases
of complex freeway setups. All combinations of the previ-
ously discussed, “elementary” traffic patterns are possible.
Furthermore, we expect particular patterns due to inter-
actions among patterns through spillover effects. For illus-
tration, let us focus here on the combination of an on-ramp
with an off-ramp further upstream. This freeway design is
illustrated in Fig. 8 and often built to reduce the magni-
tude of traffic breakdowns, since it is favorable when vehi-
cles leave the freeway before new ones enter. Nevertheless,
the on-ramp and the off-ramp bottleneck can get coupled,
namely when congestion upstream of the on-ramp reaches
the location of the off-ramp.

What would a bottleneck analysis analogous to the one
in Sec. 4 predict for this setup? In order to discuss this, let
us again denote the outflow capacity downstream of the
on-ramp by Qout, its bottleneck strength equivalent to the
on-ramp flow Qrmp = Qon by ∆Qon = Qrmp/Ifr ≥ 0, the
upstream flow by Qup, and the average congested flow re-
sulting immediately upstream of the on-ramp by Qcong.
In contrast, we will denote the same quantities relating
to the area of the off-ramp by primes (′), but we will in-
troduce the abbreviation −∆Qoff = Q′rmp/Ifr ≤ 0 for the
effect of the off-ramp flow Q′rmp ≤ 0.

According to Fig. 8, we observe the following dynam-
ics: First, traffic breaks down at the strongest bottleneck,
which is the on-ramp. If Qup > Qout − ∆Qon, congested
flow of size Qcong = Qout−∆Qon expands, and eventually
reaches the location of the off-ramp, see Fig. 8(a). After-
wards, the freeway capacity downstream of the off-ramp
suddenly drops from Q′out = Qout to the congested flow

Q′out = Qcong = Qout −∆Qon (21)

due to a spillover effect. This abrupt change in the bottle-
neck capacity restricts the capacity for the flow upstream
of the off-ramp to

Q′cong = Qcong +∆Qoff ≥ Qcong . (22)

This higher flow capacity implies either free flow or milder
congestion upstream of the off-ramp. If Q′cong is smaller
than the previous outflow capacity Qout, we have a bot-
tleneck along the off-ramp, and its effective strength ∆Q
is given by the difference of these values:

∆Q = Qout − (Qcong +∆Qoff) = ∆Qon −∆Qoff . (23)

up − ∆Qoff up-
stream of the on-ramp exceeds Qcong, which is defined as the
outflow Qout from congested traffic minus the on-ramp flow
∆Qon = Qon/Ifr, congested traffic upstream of the on-ramp
(dark grey area) is expected to grow. (b) As soon as the con-
gested area extends up to the location of the off-ramp, the off-
ramp bottleneck is activated. Its effective outflow Q′out is given
by the congested flow Qcong upstream of the on-ramp, while
congested flow Q′cong upstream of the off-ramp is higher by the
amount ∆Qoff = Qoff/Ifr of the off-ramp flow. (c) Spatiotem-
poral velocity field resulting from a computer simulation with
the gas-kinetic-based traffic model (GKT) [27], which allows to
treat ramps easily. The arrow indicates the driving direction.
One can clearly see pronounced stop-and-go waves emanating
from an area of oscillating congested traffic.

That is, the bottleneck strength is defined as the amount
of outflow from congested traffic which cannot be served
by the off-ramp and the downstream freeway flow. For
Qcong + ∆Qoff ≥ Qout, no bottleneck occurs, which cor-
responds to a bottleneck strength ∆Q = 0. This finally
results in the expression

∆Q = max(∆Qon −∆Qoff , 0) ≤ ∆Qon (24)
[38]. Whenever∆Qoff > ∆Qon, there is no effective bottle-
neck upstream of the off-ramp, i.e. the off-ramp bottleneck
is de-activated. For ∆Q = ∆Qon − ∆Qoff > 0, however,
the resulting congested flow upstream of the off-ramp be-
comes

Q′cong = Q
′

out+∆Qoff = Qout−∆Qon+∆Qoff = Qout−∆Q .
(25)

In conclusion, if congested traffic upstream of an on-ramp
reaches an upstream off-ramp, the off-ramp becomes a
bottleneck of strength ∆Q, which is given by the differ-
ence between the on-ramp and the off-ramp flows (or zero,
if this difference would be negative).

Since ∆Q ≤ ∆Qon according to Eq. (24) and Q′cong ≥
Qcong according to Eq. (22), the congestion upstream of
the off-ramp tends to be “milder” than the congestion
upstream of the on-ramp. The resulting traffic pattern is
often characterized by homeogeneous or oscillating con-
gested traffic between the off-ramp and the on-ramp, and
by stop-and-go waves upstream of the off-ramp, i.e. it
has typically the appearance of a “pinch effect” [40] (see
Fig. 8c). For this reason, Kerner also calls the “pinch ef-
fect” a “general pattern” [15].14

6 Other Phase Diagrams and Universality
Classes of Models

The phase diagram approach can also be used for a clas-
sification of traffic models. By today, there are hundreds
of traffic models, and many models have a similar good-
ness of fit, when parameters are calibrated to empirical
data [41,42,43,44,45,46]. It is, therefore, difficult, if not
impossible, to determine “the best” traffic model. How-
ever, one can classify models according to topologically

14 Oscillatory congestion patterns upstream of off-ramps are
further promoted by a behavioral feedback, since drivers may
decide to leave the freeway in response to downstream traffic
congestion.

equivalent phase diagrams. Usually, there would be several
models in the same universality class, producing qualita-
tively the same set of traffic patterns under roughly sim-
ilar conditions. Among the models belonging to the same
universality class, one could basically select any model.
According to the above, the differences in the goodness
of fit are usually not dramatic. Models with many model
parameters may even suffer from insignificant parameters
or parameters, which are hard to calibrate, at the cost
of predictive power. Therefore, it is most reasonable to
choose the simplest representative of a universality class
which, however, should fulfil minimum requirements re-
garding theoretical consistency.

Before we enter the comparison with empirical data,
let us discuss a number of phase diagrams expected for cer-
tain kinds of traffic models. Particular specifications of the
optimal velocity model, for example, are linearly unstable
for one density ρc2 = ρc3 only, but show unstable be-
havior in an extended density regime for sufficiently large
perturbations (i.e. extended metastable regimes) [34]. The
schematic phase diagram expected in this case is shown
in Fig. 9. Some other traffic models have linearly unstable
and metastable regimes, but do not show a restabilisation
at very high densities, i.e. ρc4 = ρjam (see Fig. 10), and
sometimes one even has ρc3 = ρjam [47,48] (see Fig. 11). In
the latter case, homogeneous congested traffic does not ex-
ist. In models such as the IDM, the restabilisation depends
on the chosen parameter values [35], see also Appendix B.

In most of the currently studied traffic models, one
has either both, linearly unstable and metastable density
ranges, or unconditionally stable traffic. In principle, how-
ever, models with linearly unstable but no metastable
regimes are conceivable. For example, they may be es-
tablished by taking a conventional model and introducing
a dependence on the square of the velocity gradient (in
macroscopic models) or the velocity difference (in micro-
scopic models).

A linearly unstable model without metastable ranges
would correspond to ρc2 = ρc1 and ρc4 = ρc3. For such
models, we do not expect any multi-stability (see Fig. 12),
and localized congested traffic would only be possible un-
der special conditions [12,7] (e.g. on freeway sections be-
tween off- and on-ramps). If, in addition, there is no resta-

the IDM) can be parameterized to reproduce this case.

bilisation (i.e. ρc3 = ρjam), only free traffic and oscillating
congested traffic should exist. This seems to reflect the sit-
uation for the classical Nagel-Schreckenbergmodel [49], al-
though the situation is somewhat unclear, since this model
is stochastic and an exact distinction between free and
congested states is difficult in this model.

Finally, we would like to discuss the fluid-dynamic
model by Lighthill and Whitham [37], which does not dis-
play any instabilities [30] and, consequently, has only ho-
mogeneous patterns, namely free traffic for Qtot ≤ Qmax
and (homogeneous) extended congested traffic for Qtot >
Qmax (which corresponds to a vehicle platoon behind the
bottleneck). This is illustrated in Fig. 13. The two phases
can also be distinguished locally, if temporal correlations
are considered: While perturbations in free traffic travel
in forward direction, in the congested regime they travel
backward.

We underline again that, by changing model parame-
ters (corresponding to different driving styles), the result-
ing instability and phase diagrams of many traffic models
change as well. For example, the IDM can be parameter-
ized to generate most of the stability diagrams discussed
in this contribution. Since different parameter values cor-
respond to different driving styles or prevailing velocities,
this may explain differences between empirical observa-
tions in different countries. For example, oscillating con-
gested traffic seems to occur less frequent in the United
States [50,51].

Finally, note that somewhat different phase diagrams
result for models that are characterized by a complex ve-
hicle dynamics and no existence of a fundamental dia-
gram [48,52]. Nevertheless, similarities can be discovered
(see Sec. 4).

Fig. 14. The outflowsQout of congestion patterns correlate sig-
nificantly with the weather-dependent range of visibility (me-
teorological optical range 3/σ). This was determined by mea-
suring the extinction coefficient σ, using multiple laser reflec-
tions. “W” denotes traffic breakdowns when the road surface
was wet, while “D” stands for a dry road surface. Note that
there are three cases of congestion marked with a lower-case
“w”, which were related with a short and light shower only, so
that the outflow values stayed comparatively high. For details
see Ref. [53].

The remaining challenge in this paper is to find the
universality class that fits the stylized facts of traffic dy-
namics well. Here, we will primarily demand that it fits the
empirical phase diagram, i.e. reproduces all elementary
congestion patterns observed, and not more. We have eval-
uated empirical data from the German freeway A5 close to
Frankfurt. Due to the weather-dependence of the outflows
Qout (see Fig. 14), it is important to scale all flows by the
respective measurements of Qout. This naturally collapses
the area of localized congested traffic states to a line. As
Fig. 15 shows, the phase diagram after scaling the flows is
very well compatible with the theoretical phase diagrams
of Figs. 5 and 6. Since the determination of the empirical
phase diagram did not focus on the detection of “widen-
ing synchronized patterns”, it does not allow us to clearly
distinguish between the two phase diagrams, i.e. to decide
whether ρc2 > ρmax or ρc2 < ρmax. However, the empirical
WSP displayed in Fig. 1 suggests that Fig. 6 correspond-
ing to ρc2 > ρmax would be the right choice. Another piece
of evidence for this is the metastability of vehicle platoons
forming behind overtaking trucks (see Ref. [8]).15

15 The existence of “widening moving clusters”, see Sec. 4.2
and Fig. 1(a), supports this view as well.

be clearly seen that the non-extended traffic states are scat-
tered around the line Qtot/Qout = (Qup + ∆Q)/Qout = 1, as
expected, while the extended traffic states are above this line.
Moreover, pinned localized clusters, moving localized clusters,
and stop-and-go waves/oscillating congested traffic are well
separated from each other. Homogeneous congested traffic, but
not other traffic states were observed for ∆Q/Qout & 0.5 (see
Ref. [7]).

7.1 Reply to Criticisms of Phase Diagrams for Traffic
Models with a Fundamental Diagram

In the following, we will face the criticism of the phase
diagram approach by Kerner [54,15]:

1. Models containing a fundamental diagram could not
explain the wide scattering of flow-density data ob-
served for “synchronized” congested traffic flow. This
is definitely wrong, as a wide scattering is excellently
reproduced by considering the wide distribution of ve-
hicle gaps, partially due to different vehicle classes such
as cars and trucks [55,56]. Note that, for a good repro-
duction of empirical measurements, it is important to
apply the same measurement procedure to empirical
and simulated data, in particular the data aggregation
over a finite time period.

2. As the ramp flow or the overall traffic volume Qtot is
increasing, the phase diagram approach would predict
the transitions free traffic → moving or pinned local-
ized cluster→ stop-and-go traffic/oscillating congested
traffic→ homogeneous congested traffic. However, this
would be wrong because (i) homogeneous congested
traffic would not exist [57,58], and (ii) according to
the “pinch effect”, wide moving jams (i.e. moving lo-
calized clusters) should occur after the occurrence of
“synchronized flow” (i.e. extended congested traffic)
[39].
We reply to (i) that it would be easy to build a car-
following model with a fundamental diagram that pro-



D. Helbing, M. Treiber, A. Kesting and M. Scho¨nhof: Classification and Prediction of Congested Traffic States 13

duces no HCT states,16 but according to empirical
data, homogeneous congested traffic does exist (see
Fig. 1f), but it occurs very rarely and only for ex-
tremely large bottleneck strengths exceeding ∆Q ≈
0.5Qout [7]. As freeways are dimensioned such that
bottlenecks of this size are avoided, HCT occurs pri-
marily when freeway lanes are closed after a serious
accident. In other words, when excluding cases of acci-
dents from the data set, HCT states will normally not
be found.
Moreover, addressing point (ii), Kerner is wrong in
claiming that our theoretical phase diagramwould nec-
essarily require moving localized clusters to occur be-
fore the transition to stop-and-go waves or oscillating
congested traffic. This misunderstanding might have
occurred by ignoring the dependence of the resulting
traffic state on the perturbation size. The OCT pat-
tern of Fig. 3(c) clearly shows that a direct transition
from free traffic flow to oscillating congested traffic is
possible in cases of small perturbations. The same ap-
plies to a fast increase in the traffic volume Qtot(t),
which is typical during rush hours.

3. The variability of the empirical outflow Qout would not
be realistically accounted for by traffic models with a
fundamental diagram. This variability, however, does
not require an explanation based on complex vehicle
dynamics. To a large extent, it can be understood by
variations in the weather conditions (see Fig. 14) and
in the flow conditions on the freeway lanes in the neigh-
borhood of ramps [7], which is particularly affected by
a largely varying truck fraction [55].

In summary, the phase diagram approach for traffic mod-
els with a fundamental diagram has been criticized with
invalid arguments.

7.2 On the Validity of Traffic Models

In the past decades, researchers have proposed a large
number of traffic models and it seems that there often
exist several different explanations for the same observa-
tion(s) [35]. As a consequence, it is conceivable that there
are models which are macroscopically correct (in terms of
reproducing the observed congestion patterns discussed
above), but microscopically wrong. In order to judge the
validity of competing traffic models, we consider it neces-
sary to compare models in a quantitative way, based on
empirical data. This should include

– a definition of suitable performance measures (such as
the deviation between simulated and measured travel
times or velocity profiles),

– the implementation and parameter calibration of the
competing models with typical empirical data sets, and

– the comparison of the performance of the competing
models for different test data sets of representative
traffic situations.

16 An example would be the IDM with the parameter choice
s1 = 0.

Based on data sets of car-following experiments, such
analyses have, for example, been performed with a num-
ber of follow-the-leader models [41,42,43,44,45,46], with
good results in particular for the intelligent driver model
(IDM) [42,43,46]. If there is no statistically significant dif-
ference in the performance of two models (based on an
analysis of variance), preference should be given to the
simpler one, according to Einstein’s principle that a model
should be always as simple as possible, but not simpler.

We would like to point out that over-fitting of a model
must be avoided. This may easily happen for models with
many parameters. Fitting such models to data will, of
course, tend to yield smaller errors than fitting models
with a few parameters only. Therefore, one needs to make
a significance analysis of parameters that adjusts for the
number of parameters, as it is commonly done in statis-
tical analyses. Reproducing a certain calibration data set
well does not necessarily mean that an independent test
data set will be well reproduced. While the descriptive ca-
pability of models with many parameters is often high,
models with fewer parameters may have a higher predic-
tive capability, as their parameters are often easier to cal-
ibrate.

This point is particularly important, since it is known
that traffic flows fluctuate considerably, especially in the
congested regime. So, one may pose the question whether
these fluctuations are meaningful dynamical features of
traffic flows or just noise. To some extent, this depends on
the question to be addressed by the model, i.e. how fine-
grained predictions the model shall be able to make. There
are certainly systematic sources of fluctuations, such as
lane-changes, in particular by vehicles entering or leav-
ing the freeway via ramps, different types of vehicles, and
different driver behaviors [45,46]. Such issues would most
naturally be addressed by multi-lane models considering
lane changes and heterogeneous driver-vehicle units [6].
Details like this may, in particular, influence the outflow
Qout of congested traffic flow (see Fig. 17 in Ref. [7]).
When trying to understand the empirically observed vari-
ability of the outflow, however, one also needs to take the
variability of the weather conditions and the visibility into
account (see Fig. 14). In order to show that car-following
models with a fundamental diagram are inferior to other
traffic models in terms of reproducing microscopic features
of traffic flows (even when multi-lane multi-class features
are considered), one would have to show with standard
statistical procedures that these other models can explain
a larger share of the empirically observed variance, and
that the difference in the explanation power is significant,
even when the number of model parameters is considered.
To the knowledge of the authors, however, such a statis-
tical analysis has not been presented so far.

8 Summary, Conclusions, and Outlook

After a careful discussion of the term “traffic phase”, we
have extended the phase diagram concept to traffic mod-
els with a fundamental diagram that are not only capable



14 D. Helbing, M. Treiber, A. Kesting and M. Scho¨nhof: Classification and Prediction of Congested Traffic States

of reproducing congestion patterns such as localized clus-
ters, stop-and-go waves, oscillatory congested traffic, or
homogeneous congested traffic, but also “widening syn-
chronized patterns” (WSP) and “widening moving clus-
ters” (WMC). The discovery of these states for the case,
where the maximum traffic flow lies in the metastable den-
sity regime, was quite unexpected. It offers an alternative
and – from our point of view – simpler interpretation of
some of Kerner’s empirical findings. A particular advan-
tage of starting from models with a fundamental diagram
is the possibility of analytically deriving the schematic
phase diagram of traffic states from the instability dia-
gram, which makes the approach predictive.

Furthermore, we have discussed how the phase dia-
gram approach can be used to classify models into uni-
versality classes. Models within one universality class are
essentially equivalent, and one may choose any, preferably
the simplest representative satisfying minimum require-
ments regarding theoretical consistency. The universality
class should be chosen in agreement with empirical data.
These were well represented by the schematic phase dia-
gram in Fig. 6. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that
one needs to implement the full details of a freeway de-
sign, in particularly all on- and off-ramps, as these details
matter for the resulting congestion patterns. Multi-ramp
designs lead to congestion patterns composed of several
elementary congestion patterns, but spillover effects must
be considered. In this way, a simple explanation of the
“pinch effect” [39] and the so-called “general pattern” [15]
results. We have also replied to misunderstandings of the
phase diagram concept.

In conclusion, the phase diagram approach is a simple
and natural approach, which can explain empirical find-
ings well, in particular the dependence of traffic patterns
on the flow conditions. Note that the phase diagram ap-
proach is a metatheory rather than a model. It can be
theoretically derived from the instability diagram of traf-
fic flows and the self-organized outflow from seriously con-
gested traffic. This is not a triviality and, apart from this,
the phase diagram approach is more powerful than the in-
stability diagram itself: It does not only allow predictions
regarding the possible appearance of traffic patterns and
possible transitions between them. It also allows to pre-
dict whether it is an extended or localized traffic pattern,
or whether a localized cluster moves or not. Furthermore,
it facilitates the prediction of the spreading dynamics of
congestion in space, as reflected by Eqs. (7) and (12). This
additionally requires formula (11), which determines how
the bottleneck strength ∆Q determines the effective flow
capacity Qcong of the upstream freeway section.

A Modeling of Source and Sink Terms (In-
and Outflows)

In this appendix, we will focus on the case of a freeway
section with a single bottleneck such as an isolated on-
ramp. Scenarios with several bottlenecks are discussed in
Sec. 5.

In order to derive the appropriate form of source and
sink terms due to on- or off-ramps, we start from the conti-
nuity equation, which reflects the conservation of the num-
ber of vehicles. If ρ∗(x, t) represents the one-dimensional
density of vehicles at time t and a location x along the free-
way, and if Q∗(x, t) represents the vehicle flow measured
at a cross section of the freeway, the continuity equation
can be written as follows:

∂ρ∗(x, t)

∂t
+

∂Q∗(x, t)

∂x
= 0 . (26)

Now, assume that I(x) is the number of freeway lanes
at location x. We are interested in the density ρ(x, t) =
ρ∗(x, t)/I(x) and traffic flow Q(x, t) = Q∗(x, t)/I(x) per
freeway lane. Inserting this into the continuity equation
(26) and carrying out partial differentiation, applying the
product rule of Calculus, we get

∂

∂t

[
I(x)ρ(x, t)

]
= I(x)

∂ρ(x, t)

∂t

= − ∂
∂x

[
I(x)Q(x, t)

]
= −Q(x, t)dI(x)

dx
− I(x)∂Q(x, t)

∂x
. (27)

Rearranging the different terms, we find

∂ρ(x, t)

∂t
+

∂Q(x, t)

∂x
= −Q(x, t)

I(x)

dI(x)

dx
. (28)

The first term of this equation looks exactly like the con-
tinuity equation for the density ρ∗(x, t) over the whole
cross section at x. The term on the right-hand side of the
equality sign describes an increase of the density ρ(x, t)
per lane, whenever the number of freeway lanes is re-
duced (∂I(x)/∂x < 0) and all vehicles have to squeeze
into the remaining lanes. In contrast, the density per
lane ρ(x, t) goes down, if the width of the road increases
(∂I(x)/∂x > 0).

It is natural to treat on- and off-ramps in a similar way
by the continuity equation

example, if a one-lane on-ramp flow Qon(t) is entering the
freeway uniformly over an effectively used ramp length of

upstream and downstream of the ramp, which is assumed
to be the same, here. The sink term due to off-ramp flows

B Parameter Dependence of the Instability
Thresholds in the Intelligent Driver Model

The acceleration function aIDM(s, v,∆v) of the intelligent
driver model (IDM) [10] depends on the gap s to the lead-
ing vehicle, the velocity v, and the velocity difference ∆v
(positive, when approaching). It is given by

aIDM(s, v,∆v) = a

, (32)

where

s∗(v,∆v) = s0 + s1

√

. (33)

For identical driver-vehicle units, there exists a one-
parameter class of homogeneous and stationary solutions
defining the “microscopic” fundamental diagram ve(s) via
aIDM(s, ve(s), 0) = 0. From a standard linear analysis
around this solutions it follows that the IDM is linearly
stable if the condition

(34)

is fulfilled. With the micro-macro relation

s =
1

ρ
− lveh, where lveh = 6m, (35)

this defines the stability boundaries ρc2 and ρc3 as a func-
tion of the model parameters v0 (desired velocity), T (de-
sired time headway), a (desired acceleration), b (desired
deceleration), s0 (minimum gap), and s1 (gap parame-
ter; if nonzero, the fundamental diagram has an inflection
point). The overall stability can be controlled most effec-
tively by the acceleration a. Setting the other parameters
to the values used in Fig. 4 [v0 = 128 km/h, T = 1 s,
s0 = 2m, s1 = 10m, and b = 1.3m/s

2], we obtain

– unconditional linear stability for a ≥ 1.68m/s2,
– linear instability in the density range ρc2 ≤ ρ ≤ ρc3
for 0.95m/s2 ≤ a ≤ 1.68m/s2, where ρc2 > ρmax and
ρc3 < ρjam. In this situation, corresponding to Figs.
4(c) and (d), the instability range lies completely on
the “congested” side of the fundamental diagram.

– Finally, for a ≤ 0.95m/s2, the linear instability also
extends to the “free branch” of the fundamental dia-
gram (ρc2 < ρmax), corresponding to Figs. 4 (a) and
(b).

The upper instability threshold ρc3 can be controlled
nearly independently from the lower instability thresh-
old ρc2 by the gap parameters s0 and s1. Generally, ρc3
increases with decreasing values of s1. In particular, if
s1 = 0, one obtains the analytical result ρc3 = (lveh+s0)

−1

for any a < s0/T
2, and unconditional linear stability for

a > s0/T
2. As can be seen from the last expression, the in-

stability generally becomes more pronounced for decreas-
ing values of the time headway parameter T , which is plau-
sible.

The additional influence of the parameter b according
to computer simulations is plausible as well: With decreas-
ing values of b, the sensitivity with respect to velocity dif-
ferences increases, and the instability tends to decrease.
Further simulations suggest that the IDM has metastable
density areas only when linearly unstable densities ex-
ist. Metastability at densities above the linear instability
range additonally requires s1 > 0.
