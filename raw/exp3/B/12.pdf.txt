In this paper, we incorporate a limitation on the interaction range between neighboring
vehicles into the cellular automaton model proposed by Gao and Jiang et al. [K. Gao,
R. Jiang, S. X. Hu, B. H. Wang and Q. S. Wu, Phys. Rev. E 76 (2007) 026105], which was
established within the framework of Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory and has been
shown to be able to reproduce the three-phase traffic flow. This modification eliminates an
unrealistic phenomenon found in the previousmodel, where the velocity-adaptation effect
between neighboring vehicles can exist even if those vehicles are infinitely far away from
each other. Therefore, in the improved model, we regulate that such interactions can only
occur within a finite distance. For simplicity, we suppose a constant value to describe this
distance in this paper. As a result, when compared to the previous model, the improved
model mainly simulates the following results which are believed to be an improvement.
(1) The improved model successfully reproduces the expected discontinuous transition
from free flow to synchronized flow and the related ‘‘moving synchronized flow pattern’’,
which are both absent in the original model but have been observed in real traffic. (2) The
improved model simulates the correlation functions, time headway distributions and
optimal velocity functions which are all more consistent with the empirical data than
the previous model and most of the other models published before. (3) Together with
the previous two models considering the velocity-difference effect, this model finally
accomplishes a significative process of developing traffic flow models from the traditional
‘‘fundamental diagram approach’’ to the three-phase traffic theory. This process should be
helpful for us to understand the traffic dynamics and mechanics further and deeper.

1. Introduction: Traffic flow theory and traffic flow models

Vehicular traffic has become a title of physics over the last sixty years. Traffic states are often described as some
kinds of fluid or flow thus are widely called the ‘‘traffic flow’’. The dynamics of traffic flow can be recognized as some
certain evolutionary motions of typical nonlinear complex systems and have attracted much interest from physicists and
mathematicians [1–13]. In order to explore the essential rules of the traffic flow, researchers carried out large amounts of
traffic measures and observations, and established various types of theoretical or computational models based on the data.
Usually, there are many different ways to explore the traffic models, under different theoretical hypothesis. With phase
transition thought to exist in traffic flow, the fundamental diagram approach (two-phase hypothesis) and the three-phase
traffic theory (three-phase hypothesis) have now become the main branches of the modern traffic flow theories.

1.1. The fundamental diagram approach

From the 1950s on, several different approaches were developed to simulate the traffic flow, including the macroscopic
models (the hydrodynamics models [14–20]), the mesoscopic models (the gas-kinetic models [21–24] and the microscopic
models (the car-following models [25,26] and the cellular automaton models [27–30]). Since the phase transition theory
was applied on the traffic flow research, most traffic flow models or empirical formulations were established based on a
two-phase hypothesis, under which the traffic states can be classified into two different traffic phases, i.e., the free flow (F )
phase and the jammed phase (J). These two traffic phases have obvious differences in their spatial-temporal features and
can be distinguished by a phase-transition point in the flow-density plane. The flow-density curve, which goes across the
original point and has at least one maximum, is often called ‘‘the fundamental diagram’’ of traffic flow. Therefore, traffic
theories in this framework are summarized as a ‘‘fundamental diagram approach’’ [2,3,31].
The fundamental diagram approach is quite successful in describing the traffic states and traffic evolutions. It can

reproduce important features like the forming and dissolving of queues in the traffic system. So it has been widely
accepted and well developed during the past decades. However, the two-phase classification in the fundamental diagram
approach implies that there are only two kinds of traffic states, either free flow or jams, could be long-time steady and
form a phase. Intermediate states between them, usually shown as low-speed but uninterrupted traffic states, are not yet
studied adequately. These states are simply considered as temporary and unsteady states, which are of little importance
to the features of the traffic system. Therefore, the fundamental diagram approach studies the traffic flow in a static way.
Interactions between vehicles are either vanished (in free flow) or extremely strong (in jams), without any intermediate
status. Dynamically equivalent states, which should be very popular in real traffic, are seldom studied in the fundamental
diagram approach.

1.2. Kerner’s three-phase traffic theory

Based on a fairly long observation of the traffic flowon theGerman highways A5, A1, A44, and A3 between 1995 and 1998,
B.S. Kerner introduced a three-phase traffic theory [32,33], which has been used by Kerner together with his colleagues for
the development of some three-phase traffic flow models and methods of traffic engineering [34–43]. Three-phase traffic
theory shows us a brand new prospect on the highway traffic systems [32–40,44,45]. It impels forward the previous phase-
transition theory in the traffic flow from a two-phase limitation to a possible multi-phase structure. Being different to the
traditional ‘‘fundamental diagram approach’’, three-phase traffic theory further distinguished the congested traffic states
into wide moving jams and a newly defined state called the ‘‘synchronized flow’’ (S). Synchronized flow can be considered
as an intermediate state between the free flow and thewide-moving jams, withmiddle levels of speeds, densities and fluxes.
Being different to the temporary states in the fundamental diagram approach, synchronized flow contains inner fluctuations
within a fairly wide amplitude, but the entire phase can be kept long-time steady and nearly homogeneous. It also has its
own characteristics thus could possibly be distinguished as an individual phase. As a result, there are totally three different
types of traffic states which divide all the possible traffic flow states into three traffic phases, i.e., the free flow (F ), the
synchronized flow (S) and the wide moving jams (J).
Supposed to be different phases, free flow, synchronized flow and wide moving jams should have distinguishable

properties of their own. As we know from the fundamental diagram approach, free flow could be characterized by the
weak interactions among vehicles, while wide moving jams could be characterized by the long-time stop of vehicles and
extremely strong blocks. In the sameway, for synchronized flow, Kerner pointed out that synchronized flow is characterized
by a considerably high flux without any clear density-flux relations. The speeds of vehicles, and the distances or interactions
between vehicles, are all middle-leveled and quite flexible. Furthermore, Kerner has proposed a fundamental hypothesis of
his three-phase traffic theory, which says that the steady states of synchronized flow cover a two-dimensional region in the
flow-density plane. Evolutions within the synchronized flow phase are represented as random walks of the data points in
the flow-density plane. Synchronized flow usually looks nearly homogeneous in macroscopic scales in the spatial-temporal
diagram and can keep steady for quite a long time until a phase transition occurs [32–40,44–48].
As we can see, the definition of the synchronized flow and the phase transitions between the synchronized flow phase

and the other two traffic phases would be the kernel of the three-phase traffic theory. In Kerner’s hypothesis, all the phase
transitions among the three traffic phases are first-order/discontinuous. However, only the phase transition between free
flow and synchronized flow (F ↔ S) and the phase transition between synchronized flow and wide moving jams (S ↔ J)
can spontaneously occur. Under ceratin scales of vehicle densities, either of these two phase transitions can occur with
probabilities, induced by the random fluctuations occurring somewhere in the traffic flow. When the extent of the random
fluctuation is higher than a threshold value, the phase transition occurs. The probability of the phase transition will increase
with an increase of density or time. On the other hand, the phase transition from free flow to jams (F → S) can only occur
due to some external inducements such as traffic signals or closure of the road.
With these three traffic phases and two phase transitions occurring with probabilities among them, the three-phase

traffic theory has provided an instructive viewpoint to understand the traffic dynamics and the empirical findings. In
particular, the three-phase traffic theory gives more reasonable descriptions on the bottleneck induced congested patterns
than the fundamental diagram approach. It has been discovered from traffic observations that with different sets of flow
rates on the main road and the on-ramp, different congested patterns emerge at the upstream of the bottleneck. These

different congested patterns have different spatial-temporal features to each other, which can be qualitatively distinguished
easily. Empirical results tell us that the stop and go waves (traffic jams) can only emerge when the on-ramp flow is high
enough, namely, under a strong bottleneck; on the other hand, lower on-ramp flow (weak bottleneck) can only induce
some kinds of ‘‘homogenous congested traffic’’. In the framework of the three-phase traffic theory, Kerner differentiated the
bottleneck-induced congested states into the following six patterns by different scales of the flows: (1) general pattern (GP);
(2) widening synchronized flow pattern (WSP), (3) dissolving general pattern (DGP), (4) local synchronized flow pattern
(LSP), (5) moving synchronized flow pattern (MSP) and (6) synchronized flow pattern with alternations of free flow and
synchronized flow (ASP). Among them, GP occurs under strong bottlenecks. It consists of a synchronized flow region and a
series of spontaneously emergedwidemoving jams from the original synchronized flow region.While theWSP occurs under
weak bottlenecks, consisting of a widening region of synchronized flowwhich is nearly homogeneous. Therefore, compared
to the empirical results, the three-phase traffic theory provides consistent descriptions on these congested patterns. The
related empirical evidence has thus provided strong support for the three-phase traffic theory.
However, on the other hand, nearly all the two-phase traffic flow models, which are under the framework of the funda-

mental diagram approach, give us quite different results. In these results, stop and gowaves emerge underweak bottlenecks
while homogeneous congested traffic occurs under strong bottlenecks [8,49–51]. Simulation results are contradictory to the
empirical results. This becomes an obvious drawback for the validity of the fundamental diagram approach. As a result, the
three-phase traffic theory ismuch better sustained by empirical data and has thus come to be accepted bymore researchers.
Furthermore, investigations on single vehicle data have discovered that each of the three traffic phases has a particular

microscopic structure; even free flow is not as trivial as previously believed [52]. Therefore, a suitable traffic theory is
required not only to describe right traffic phases and phase transitions, but also to present the microscopic structures of the
traffic flow properly. These requirements bring forward new challenges to the traffic flow theories and impel researchers to
study their theories on microscopic scales.
In this paper, we will show a cellular automaton (CA) model in the framework of the three-phase traffic theory. We are

going to show this model is consistent with the empirical data and the hypothesis of the three-phase traffic theory in both
macroscopic and microscopic ways.

2. Previous models in the framework of the three-phase traffic theory

So far, there mainly exist three different series of traffic flow models which are consistent with the three-phase traffic
theory, i.e., the models by Kerner, Klenov and Wolf [41,42,53,54], the model by Lee [55], and the models by Jiang and
Wu [56,57]. These models were designed by considering different aspects of possible vehicular traffic dynamics, and most
of them were represented by cellular automaton (CA) modeling approach. In 2007, Gao, Jiang and Hu et al. proposed other
possible driving mechanics in their CA traffic flow models [58,59]. These models focus on the influence of the velocity-
difference between two successive vehicles on the randomization process of the following one (so that we call them
‘‘Velocity-difference effect (VDE)’’ series models in this paper). This mechanics reflects the fact that drivers usually adapt
their acceleration and decelerationmotions according to their relative speeds to the vehicles in front of them.When the front
vehicle moves faster, the driver will feel confident that a sudden deceleration is unlikely to be required and will feel safer
as a result. On the other hand, when the following vehicle moves faster than the front vehicle, the driver will feel nervous
and perhaps decelerate as a result of this anxiety. Similar mechanics have ever been described in the classic car-following
equations as

dvn
dt
(t) = λ∆vn (1)

in which∆vn is the velocity-difference between neighboring vehicles, and λ is the sensitive parameter.
In the VDE series models, the earliest version was published in Ref. [58] (called VDE-I model). The VDE-I model simply

substitutes the constant randomization parameter p in the NSmodel with a variable depending on the velocity-difference as

p =
{p−, For vi(t) < vi−1(t)
p0, For vi(t) = vi−1(t)
p+, For vi(t) > vi−1(t),

with all the other regulations of the NS model unchanged at the same time. This model executes the driving mechanics
mentioned above by changing the randomization probability of the following vehicle. As a result, it produces some special
states which are similar in certain aspects to the synchronized flow. In more detail, these states have quite similar spatial-
temporal features to the synchronized flow, but can’t show proper phase transition phenomena to both the free flow and
the wide moving jams. Therefore, this kind of ‘‘quasi synchronized flow state’’ hasn’t formed an individual traffic phase, and
the VDE-I model can only be considered as an intermediate model between the two-phase and the three-phase traffic flow
models. Essentially, it still belongs to the fundamental diagram approach, because only the free flow phase and jammed
phase are significant in this model. However, on the other hand, it implies the possible existence of a third phase and shows
us a possible way to develop the models from the two-phase framework to the three-phase framework.
After the VDE-Imodelwe carried out furthermodifications and developed it into a VDE-IImodel, published in Ref. [59]. In

theVDE-IImodel,we execute the velocity-difference effect by changing the deceleration extent instead of the randomization

probability in the randomization process. This is equivalent to discretizing the classic car-following equation in Eq. (1)
directly and representing it with a cellular automaton model. Furthermore, we introduced the slow-to-start effect into this
model in order to induce the spontaneous emergence of the wide moving jams, namely, the so-called pinch effect in the
three-phase traffic theory.
It is worth introducing the velocity-updating rules of the VDE-II model here. The parallel velocity-updating rules are

briefly summarized as the following two steps:

1. Accelerating and braking:

vn(t + 1) = min(vn(t)+ a, vmax, dn(t)) (2)
2. Randomization with probability pn(t + 1):

vn(t + 1)→ max(vn(t + 1)−∆v, 0).

Here vn(t) is the velocity of vehicle n at time t (vehicle n− 1 precedes vehicle n); dn is the distance from the head of vehicle
n to the tail of vehicle n − 1. Let tst,n denote the stop time of vehicle n (tst,n = mmeans vehicle n has been stopping for m
time steps currently) and tc denote the time threshold of slow-to-start effect [56,57,59,60], the randomization probability
pn(t + 1) and the deceleration extent4v are determined by the following formulations:

pn(t + 1) =
{
p0 when tst,n ≥ tc
pd when tst,n < tc

(3)

∆v =


a when tst,n ≥ tc
b− if (vn(t) < vn−1(t))
b0 if (vn(t) = vn−1(t))
b+ if (vn(t) > vn−1(t))

}
when tst,n < tc .

(4)

The rank of the acceleration and deceleration parameters above are usually required as b+ ≥ a ≥ b−. It’s the adequate
and necessary condition for the model to simulate the synchronized flow. When this condition is satisfied, the velocity-
adaptation mechanics are automatically taken into account.
With these modifications, the VDE-II model shows characteristics much more consistent with the three-phase traffic

theory than the previous VDE-I model. In the VDE-II model, three traffic phases are clearly distinguished, and the phase
transitions among them occur with probabilities under proper density scales. This model can successfully reproduce the
synchronized flow phase and the spontaneous discontinuous S → J transition, as well as the corresponding congested
patterns induced by the bottleneck. However, the F → S transition in this model is not first-order but continuous. This
means under any fixed vehicle densities, synchronized flow cannot spontaneously occur in free flow. In Kerner’s viewpoint,
both the F → S transition (breakdown phenomenon) and the S → J transition (pinch effect) can spontaneously occur under
some certain densities, even on a homogeneous road. In Particular, when the breakdown phenomenon occurs, a ‘‘moving
synchronized flow patten’’ (MSP) emerges [41,43,54]. These results are still absent in the VDE-II model.
We have discussed in Ref. [59] that Eq. (4) can be seen as another mathematical formulation of the speed-adaptation

effect firstly proposed by Kerner in Refs. [41,43]. Our VDE-II model can bee seen as a combination of the KKWmodel and the
Nagel–Schreckenberg model with slow-to-start effect. The velocity-adaptation effect can produce the synchronized flow
and keep it in dynamical steady states. It’s the kernel of the model to simulate the three-phase traffic flow in both the KKW
models and the VDE-II model. However, on the other hand, it still needs additional mechanics to produce the first-order
F → S transition. Therefore, in order to supply the absence of the breakdown phenomenon and the related MSP in the
VDE-II model, we continued our work and proposed an improved model in this paper.

3. The VDE-III model

In the viewpoint of physics, the VDE-IImodel has overlooked the fact that the interaction range of a certain vehicle should
be finite. However, in the VDE-II model, each vehicle can influence the randomization process of its following vehicle even
if the follower is infinitely far away. As a result, metastable states of the free flow would be easily broken by the infinite-
ranged interactions between neighboring vehicles, which causes the absence of the coexisting scale of the free flow and
the synchronized flow. In this paper, following Kerner’s idea [42], we are going to take into account the finite interaction
range between neighboring vehicles.When exceeding this range, denoted byDn, the randomization process of the following
vehicle will become weak and independent of the preceding vehicle. Following this idea, Eqs. (3) and (4) are improved into

pn(t + 1) =
{p0 when (tst,n ≥ tc)
pd when (tst,n < tc & dn ≤ Dn)
ps when (tst,n < tc & dn > Dn)

Here ps and bs are relatively smaller values. The parameters are selected as tc = 6, vmax = 25, pd = 0.18, p0 = 0.5, ps = 0.08,
a = 2, b− = bs = 1, b0 = 2, b+ = 5. The spatial and temporal units are selected as 1.5 m and 1 s respectively, and Dn is
simplified as a constant D = 23.
It should be noted that a similar idea has also been presented in Kener’s models [41,43]. In the KKW series models, the

interaction rangeDn is defined as a ‘‘synchronization distance’’Dn(∆x, v), whichmay be a function of the speed andheadway
distance. However, in this paper, we just simplify Dn to be a constant. It can be considered as one special mathematical
formulation of the synchronize distance. As we are going to show in the following part, the model in this paper shows
results which are reasonable enough under this special setting up of Dn. On the other hand, this constant Dn also creates
small changes in the features of the synchronized flow to Kerner’s models.
As well as the previous VDE-II model in Ref. [59], the VDE-III model is also equivalent to a combination of the KKW CA

model [41] and the Nagel–Schreckenberg (NS) model with the slow-to-start effect [30,60] (see Eqs. (5) and (6) in Ref. [59]).
Different model rules are adopted for producing different traffic phases respectively. (i) Within the interaction distance D,
the updating rules of the model switch between the rules of the KKW model and the NS model with probabilities pd (NS
→ KKW) and 1 − pd (KKW→ NS) respectively, which reproduces the synchronized flow states. (ii) At farther distance
dn > D, no switching between the two models occurs, the rules of the NS model with weaker noise (ps < pd) reproduces
the free flow states, including the metastable states which is essentially important to the discontinuous F → S transiton.
(iii) In the case tst,n ≥ tc , the slow-to-start effect induces the spontaneous emergence of wide moving jams in the regions of
synchronized flow.
By introducing the interaction range parameter D into the model, there are only short-range interactions between

vehicles. As a result, the two-dimensional region covered by synchronized states has also be changed. Now we discuss
the theoretical two-dimensional synchronized flow region under a noiseless limit pd → 1. In this case, the updating rules
of the KKWmodel are adopted. As in the VDE-II model, the upper boundary U and the left boundary F are also determined
by the safe speed and the maximum speed respectively, i.e.,

U : JU(ρ) = vρ = dρ = 1− ρl
and

F : JF (ρ) = ρvmax
where ρ is the density of vehicles, d is the distance between neighboring vehicles and l is the average length of a single
vehicle (see Ref. [59]). There is still no lower boundary L in this model. However, the interaction range parameter D further
restricted d < D, i.e.,

S : J(S) = ρmin = 1D+ l
which defines a new left boundary F . Thus the two-dimensional region covered by the equilibrium states of the synchronized
flow is restricted by the left boundary S, upper boundary U and the x axis, as shown in Fig. 1. It is apparent in the VDE-III

model that the synchronized flow region is more limited into a scale of higher densities by comparison to the previous VDE-
II model. It should also be noticed that when a similar idea was studied by Kerner [42], the boundaries of the equilibrium
states induced by the synchronized distance Dn(∆x, v) in Kerner’s models were a little different.

4. Simulation results of the VDE-III model

With the VDE-III model, simulations are firstly carried out on a homogeneous circular road with the length L = 10 000
cells. Fig. 2 shows the fundamental diagramof themodel, inwhich three traffic phases and two discontinuous transitions are
clearly distinguished, showing a typical double Z-characteristic structure predicted by the three-phase traffic theory [42,43].
When compared to other three-phase traffic flow models published before, the current model has a much wider hysteresis
loop in flow rate scales associated with the phase transitions between the free flow and the synchronized flow. During
the simulation process, the phase transitions occur with probabilities. Under the densities between point G and C in the
diagram, both the free flow and the synchronized flow can exist. With probabilities, the discontinuous F → S transition
occurs, corresponding to a fall of the flow rate from line GB to line GC (breakdown phenomenon). The threshold point G for
the F → S transition in Fig. 2, is related to the boundary F (B)th in the diagram of congested patterns when the on-ramp flow
rate qon = 0 on an open highway system (see Fig. 17 in Ref. [53]). In the same way, under the densities between point G
and D, the discontinuous S → J transition makes the flow rate fall from line GD to line HE with probabilities (pinch effect).
The corresponding phase transition probabilities are plotted in Fig. 3(a) and (b), which increase with the increase of the

density or the simulation period. Typical patterns of these phase transitions are shown on the spatial-temporal diagrams in
Fig. 4(a) and (b).
The spontaneously emerged synchronized flow in Fig. 4(a), is usually realized as the ‘‘moving synchronized flow pattern’’

(MSP). The breakdown phenomenon with the emergence of a MSP in Kerner’s prediction is well demonstrated. On the
other hand, Kerner has also pointed out that the MSP can be induced by a bottleneck as well as other congested patterns.
These congested patterns are plotted in Fig. 5. On a main road with a single on-ramp bottleneck, with open boundary
conditions on both ends, different values of the flow rates on themain road (qin) and the on-ramp (qon) induces each of the six
congested patterns predicted by the three-phase traffic theory. They are (a) general pattern (GP), (b) widening synchronized
pattern (WSP), (c) dissolving general pattern (DGP), (d) local synchronized pattern (LSP), (e) MSP, and (f) the synchronized
pattern alternation of free and synchronized flow (ASP). These results are all qualitatively the same as those found earlier
in Refs. [41,43].

Nowwe study some statistical features of themodel based on single vehicle data or one-minute aggregated single vehicle
data, in order to identify the local structures of the model. Fig. 6(a) and (b) show the one-minute averaged flow-density
diagrams, being well consistent with the fundamental hypothesis of the three-phase traffic theory. Fig. 6(c)–(h) show the
autocorrelation functions for the local density, the averaged velocity and the flow flux. Itwas determined that in the free flow
states, the averaged velocities are only correlated on short time scales, whereas long-ranged correlations are present in the
time series of the local density aswell as the flow flux. On the other hand, in synchronized flow states, all the autocorrelations
are close to zero, whichmeans no long-range correlations exist. Furthermore, Fig. 6(i) shows the cross-correlations between
the density and the flux are strong for free flow while weak for synchronized flow.1 These results are consistent with the
empirical conclusions based on real measures published in Ref. [61].
It should be noted that the velocity anticipation effect is still not included in our models. This tells us that the velocity

anticipation effect is not necessary for reproducing the three-phase traffic flow states. However, it does have influences on
somemicroscopic features such as the timeheadwaydistributions. It has beendiscovered that the timeheadwaydistribution
of traffic flow should have a cutoff on the temporal axis at a position of less than one second [37,52,61–63], which is
impossible if the velocity anticipation effect was not considered. For this reason, we plotted the time headway distribution

〈x(t)2〉−〈x(t)〉2 and cxy(τ ) = 〈x(t)y(t+τ)〉−〈x(t)〉〈y(t)〉√〈x(t)2〉−〈x(t)〉2√〈y(t)2〉−〈y(t)〉2 . Ref. [61] has pointed out that in free flow states, for flux and density, there exist long-range

autocorrelations and strong cross-correlations, which is related to the empirical daily variations in free flow. While in synchronized flow state, no long-
range correlations could be found.

of the VDE-III model in Fig. 7, with a time anticipation embedded. For this, the dn in Eq. (2) is replaced by

deff = dn +max(0,min(vn−1(t)+ a, dn−1, vmax)− dsafe).
The safe distance dsafe here is chosen as dsafe = 15, which has no qualitative influence on the simulation results above.
We can see in Fig. 7 that the most important features of the time headway distribution, including the small time cutoff
and the uniform positions of the maximum distributions for the free flow, are well reproduced by our model. Nevertheless,
the density-dependent time headway distributions in the synchronized flow, indicated in Ref. [61,62], is still absent in our
results.We surmise thismight be related tomulti-vehiclemixtures ormulti-lane effects, andneeds to be further investigated
in the future.
Finally, we study the velocity-headway relations, i.e., the so-called optimal velocity (OV) functions. As shown in Fig. 8,

the curves for free flow and congested flow are well separated. In free flow states, the asymptotic velocity does not depend
on the density (headway), but is determined by the speed-limitation. In congested states, the asymptotic velocities are
much smaller. Furthermore, the OV functions have certain distributions under large values of the headway, which makes it
much better than most of the previous models in the framework of the three-phase traffic theory (see Ref. [64], most of the
previous three-phase traffic models do not have a distribution of the OV function under large headways). The OV functions
in Fig. 8 show features that are almost unanimous to the features shown in the Figure 4 in Ref. [62], and are consistent with
the empirical findings.

5. Conclusion

Based on our previous velocity-difference series models, as a further development, we restrict in the model rules the
interactions between neighboring vehicles to be short-ranged. This avoids an unrealistic dynamic in the VDE-II model

that vehicles always have interactions with their neighbours even if the neighbors are infinitely faraway. As a result, the
simulation results of the modified model become more consistent with the predictions of the three-phase traffic theory.
The major improvements are: (1) The improved model reproduces the discontinuous transition from the free flow to the
synchronized flow, together with the breakdown phenomenon and the moving synchronized flow pattern, which are all
absent in the previous two VDE models but have been observed by Kerner and predicted in his three-phase traffic theory.
(2) The improvedmodel shows bettermicroscopic characteristics than the previous VDEmodels. It simulates the correlation
functions identical to the empirical results not only for synchronized flow states, but also for free flow states. The result
implies that the free flow is not as trivial as we thought before. (3) The improved model reproduces most features of
the empirical time-headway distributions. On the other hand, the reproduced OV functions are highly consistent with the
empirical results, which is an obvious improvement when compared to previous models.
Besides the improvements in describing traffic characteristics, by proposing the VDE-III model in this paper, we finally

established a gradual transformation within a model series from the framework of the traditional ‘‘fundamental diagram
approach’’ to the three-phase traffic theory. From the VDE-I model to the VDE-III model, the transformation process of the
model rules and the simulation results induced by these rulesmay be helpful for our understanding of the essential dynamics
of the traffic flow. We learnt from this trip that: (1) When reproducing the synchronized flow, it may be important in the
future to determine the correct interaction mechanics between the neighboring vehicles under certain densities, such as
the velocity-difference effect, for example. (2) The slow-to-start effect shows a valuable suggestion on how wide moving
jams spontaneously emerge in some less congested regimes, like in the synchronized flow. (3) The short-range limitation
on the interactions between neighboring vehicles makes the exitance of metastable states of free flow possible and shows
us a discontinuous transition to congested traffic.
We have also leant that the parameter of the interaction range between vehicles could be effective enough under the

very simplest form. The constant parameter shows different features to the velocity-related parameters in Kerner’s models.
As for the velocity anticipation effect, it shows less importance in influencing the macroscopic features of the outputs but is
quite important to the microscopic structures.
