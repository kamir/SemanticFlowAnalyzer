proach, however, shows that trafﬁc science has still not reached a generally accepted theoretical framework.1

Modeling attempts go back to the ﬁfties of last century. It seems that Pipes (1953) came up with the ﬁrstmicroscopic traf-
ﬁc model. Until today, similar car-following models have been intensively studied (Treiber et al., 2000, 2006; Kerner and Kle-
nov, 2002). The ﬁrstmacroscopic trafﬁc model based on the ﬂuid-dynamic conservation equation dates back to the early days
of trafﬁc modeling as well (Lighthill andWhitham,1955; Richards, 1956). It is still frequently used, and has been extended in
many ways (Kühne, 1984; Kerner and Konhäuser, 1993; Hilliges et al., 1993; Daganzo, 1994; Treiber et al., 1999; Helbing,
2003). Some of these macroscopic models have been derived from gas-kinetic trafﬁc models (Prigogine,1961; Paveri-Fontana,
1975; Phillips, 1977; Hoogendoorn and Bovy, 1998; Helbing et al., 2001), others have been phenomenologically motivated.

The ﬁeld of trafﬁc modeling is now in a stage where researchers are trying to identify the best of all models. On the one
hand, this is done by testing models against empirical data (Damrath and Rose, 2002; Brockfeld et al., 2003; Knospe et al.,

After introducing the history and main points of three-phase trafﬁc theory, we continue
with a critical discussion based on its theoretical features and empirical trafﬁc data. Our
data originate from the German freeway A5 close to Frankfurt, i.e. from the same freeway
section that has been the basis for the development of three-phase trafﬁc theory. Despite of
this, we end up with partially different interpretations of the observations. In particular, we
highlight ﬁndings that are inconsistent with three-phase trafﬁc theory and facts that ques-

second-order ﬂuid approximations of trafﬁc ﬂow” (Daganzo, 1995). It showed that the most common gas-kinetic and ﬂuid-
dynamic trafﬁc models at that time had theoretical ﬂaws.

In the meantime, this criticism could be overcome by improved models (Helbing, 1995,1996; Treiber et al., 1999; Helbing,
2001, in print). Nevertheless, there are some surprising empirical observations that many trafﬁc models do not reproduce.
This has triggered many empirical analyses and new theoretical explanation approaches, including

� an extensive series of studies on empirical features of trafﬁc ﬂows (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996a,b, 1997; Kerner, 1998a,b,
2000b, 2002a,b; Kerner et al., 2006),

� a criticism of former trafﬁc simulation models (Kerner, 2002a), especially all trafﬁc models containing a fundamental
diagram,

� the interpretation of empirical observations in terms of a three-phase trafﬁc theory (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996b, 2002b,
2004), which has been repeatedly adjusted to new empirical ﬁndings, and

� the development of new, parameter-rich microscopic trafﬁc models that ﬁt the interpretations of three-phase trafﬁc theory
(Kerner and Klenov, 2002; Kerner et al., 2002; Kerner and Klenov, 2003).

These publications belong to the most inﬂuential and extensive bodies of work on trafﬁc ﬂows and have considerably
stimulated their understanding and theoretical description.

In our opinion, this also applies to the macroscopic, Navier–Stokes-like trafﬁc model (Kerner and Konhäuser, 1993) and its
implications, although this model has been questioned and dropped during the development of three-phase trafﬁc theory.

In Section 2, we will sketch the history and concept of three-phase trafﬁc theory. As this theory has become quite complex
over the years (Kerner, 2004), such a summary can certainly not be done without simpliﬁcations, i.e. we will have to restrict
ourselves to the main points of this theory. Nevertheless, we will have to spend some time on its evolution, in particular as
the theory has been adapted to new empirical ﬁndings over time. Some explanation approaches can only be understood,
when problems with previous assumptions or interpretations are taken into account (see, for example, Section 3.1.3).

Section 3 will present theoretical inconsistencies and empirical results that question three-phase trafﬁc theory as de-
scribed in the book ‘‘The Physics of Trafﬁc” (Kerner, 2004). Afterwards, in Section 4, we will X-ray the criticism of other trafﬁc
models in order to assess, whether and how it could be overcome. Finally, Section 5 presents our summary and conclusions,
including a discussion of future challenges for the theoretical modeling and empirical analysis of trafﬁc ﬂows.

2. Historical development and main points of three-phase trafﬁc theory

2.1. Modeling and simulation of jam formation before three-phase trafﬁc theory

Many publications on trafﬁc ﬂows, including the very early ones, were driven by the desire to understand the fundamen-
tal diagram (i.e. the empirical relationship between trafﬁc ﬂow and density) and the breakdown of free trafﬁc ﬂow, partic-
ularly the emergence of trafﬁc jams (see, e.g., Helbing (2001), for an overview). Particular attention has been paid to the
process of jam formation in a Navier–Stokes-like trafﬁc model (Kerner and Konhäuser, 1993). This second-order model,
which is also known as the Kerner–Konhäuser model, is related to a similar model previously studied by Kühne (1984). A
detailed investigation of the model was performed by computer simulations (Kerner and Konhäuser, 1994) and analytical
calculations (Kerner et al., 1997). These computer-based and mathematical analyses were followed by a series of empirical
studies, which started in 1996 (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996a,b, 1997; Kerner, 1998a).

The Kerner–Konhäuser model has a unique ﬂow–density relationship in the stationary and homogeneous case. However,
in a medium density range, trafﬁc ﬂow is unstable with respect to small perturbations due to a delayed adaptation of the
vehicle speed to the respective local trafﬁc situation. This can lead to the formation of ‘‘phantom trafﬁc jams” (Kerner
and Konhäuser, 1993, 1994). Vehicles in these jams have speeds close to zero and are densely packed. The jams themselves
are travelling backwards, as vehicles are moving out at the front and joining at the end. While narrow jams tend to grow, the
spatial extension of moving jams stabilizes in so-called ‘‘wide moving jams”, the spatial extension (low-velocity area) of
which is signiﬁcantly larger than the extension of their jam fronts. Wide moving jams are characterized by ‘‘characteristic
constants” such as their negative, typical propagation speed c0 and their outﬂow Qout (Kerner and Konhäuser, 1994; Kerner
and Rehborn, 1996a). These constants are related to a self-organized, linear ﬂow–density relationship, the ‘‘jam line” (Kerner
and Rehborn, 1996a; Kerner et al., 1997). According to the authors, models of wide moving jams ﬁt the related empirical
observations well (Kerner, 2004, p. 80).

2.2. Empirical classiﬁcation of trafﬁc phases and fundamental hypothesis of three-phase trafﬁc theory

Within the framework of three-phase trafﬁc theory, the ﬁrst trafﬁc phase is given by ‘‘free trafﬁc”, characterized by high
vehicle speeds which may differ among neighboring lanes. This phase is deﬁned by trafﬁc ﬂows with a monotonously
increasing and almost linear ﬂow–density relationship, while all trafﬁc states showing points in the ﬂow–density plane right
of this line are classiﬁed as congested (cf. Kerner, 2004, p. 23).

Wide moving jams constitute the second trafﬁc phase. The criteria for the presence of a wide moving jam are as follows
(Kerner and Rehborn, 1996a; Kerner, 2004): while the vehicles in the jam have very low speeds, sometimes as low as zero,



trast to the ‘wide moving jam’ trafﬁc phase, the downstream front of the ‘synchronized ﬂow’ trafﬁc phase does notmaintain

786 M. Schönhof, D. Helbing / Transportation Research Part B 43 (2009) 784–797
the mean velocity of the downstream front. In particular, the downstream front of synchronized ﬂow is often ﬁxed at a free-
way bottleneck” (see also Kerner and Rehborn (1996b)).

The name ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” was chosen since the speeds in neighboring freeway lanes showed a tendency of synchro-
nization and the ﬂow was ﬁnite, i.e. non-zero. (Note that ‘‘wide moving jams” are also characterized by speed synchroniza-
tion among lanes, but their ﬂow drops to zero.) It seems to be natural to imagine ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” as queued trafﬁc
upstream of bottlenecks of the freeway such as on-ramps, lane closures, or gradients, but this interpretation is not fully
in accordance with three-phase trafﬁc theory, as it also states that the dynamics of the downstream congestion front may
depend on details of the trafﬁc pattern upstream of the bottleneck (Kerner, 2000b). ‘‘Synchronized ﬂow” typically shows a
wide scattering of ﬂow–density data. Therefore, it completely differs from free ﬂow and the jam line (the theoretically ex-
pected, self-organized ﬂow–density relation for wide moving jams), and it establishes another trafﬁc phase. When the phe-
nomenon of ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” was published for the ﬁrst time (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996b), trafﬁc models based on a
unique ﬂow–density relationship did not convincingly reproduce the wide scattering of ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”. Within
three-phase trafﬁc theory, this discrepancy is seen as a substantial, even constitutive problem: the ‘‘fundamental hypothesis
of three-phase trafﬁc theory” postulates that each congested ﬂow–density point in synchronized ﬂow is metastable. This
would imply the existence of a ‘‘multitude of steady states” covering a large area of the ﬂow–density plane (Kerner, 1999).

2.3. Discussion

The ‘‘fundamental hypothesis of three-phase trafﬁc theory” implies by deﬁnition that trafﬁc models within the ‘‘funda-
mental diagram approach” (characterized by a one-dimensional and unique ﬂow–density relationship in the stationary
and homogeneous case) could, for principal reasons, not provide a satisfactory understanding of trafﬁc phenomena. However,
this hypothesis can not be tested. Due to the inherent wide scattering of synchronized ﬂow, the hypothetical steady states
can not be proven empirically (cf. Kerner, 2004, p. 97). Nevertheless, it is an integral part of three-phase trafﬁc theory and has
been the basis for the development of new trafﬁc models (Kerner and Klenov, 2002; Kerner et al., 2002).

From our point of view, the empirical observations, in particular the widely scattered ﬂow–density data, can also be
reproduced by simpler trafﬁc models (see Section 4.1). However, at the time when the concept of ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”
was elaborated, computer simulations of trafﬁc ﬂows were not advanced enough for this, due to the following reasons:

� First, many simulations of macroscopic trafﬁc models were restricted to periodic boundary conditions (i.e. circular trafﬁc).
Although on- and off-ramps could be added to periodic systems (Kerner et al., 1995), people had various problems sim-
ulating open systems. For example, the propagation direction of perturbations changes, when trafﬁc ﬂow breaks down,
which requires to switch between different kinds of boundary conditions (Helbing and Treiber, 1999).

� Second, most studies of macroscopic trafﬁc models were carried out with single-class models (which did not consider the
heterogeneity of driver–vehicle behaviors) and with effective single-lane models (which did not take into account the
impact of lane changes). The synchronization of ﬂows on neighboring lanes, however, is clearly a multi-lane effect involv-
ing lane changes (Shvetsov and Helbing, 1999).

� Third, the instability properties of the models were not sufﬁciently consistent with empirical data.
� Forth, the measurement process of empirical data was not properly reﬂected in the generation and evaluation of simula-
tion results.

The resulting problems, when trying to reproduce empirical ﬁndings, triggered the development of ‘‘three-phase trafﬁc
theory”, while the computer simulation of trafﬁc ﬂows was advanced in parallel, providing alternative interpretations within
the framework of models with a fundamental diagram (Helbing et al., 1999; Helbing and Treiber, 1999). Nevertheless, such
models are still criticized to contradict observed trafﬁc phenomena (Kerner, 2002a). Before we address these criticisms in
Section 4, let us ﬁrst discuss inconsistencies in the classiﬁcation of congested trafﬁc ﬂows according to three-phase trafﬁc
theory and emphasize empirical phenomena that are not well incorporated in it.

3. Criticism of three-phase trafﬁc theory

3.1. Conceptual problems

The distinction of the three different trafﬁc phases is made in practice by the patented concept FOTO/ASDA (Kerner et al.,
2004). While, theoretically, 3 rules should be sufﬁcient to classify the 3 trafﬁc phases, this concept uses 13 different quan-
the downstream jam front propagates upstream with a constant average velocity. This holds for a wide moving jam ‘‘even as
it propagates through other (possible very complex) trafﬁc states of freeway bottlenecks” (cf. Kerner, 2004, p. 27). The cita-
tion refers to later empirical results (Kerner, 2000b) concerning the interaction with another congested trafﬁc phase that of-
ten occurs upstream of bottlenecks. This constitutes the third trafﬁc phase, called ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” with signiﬁcant, non-
zero vehicle speeds (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996b)—in contrast to wide moving jams (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996a). Synchro-
nized ﬂows denote all congested trafﬁc states that cannot be classiﬁed as wide moving jam (cf. Kerner, 2004, p. 27): ‘‘In con-



titative criteria. From our point of view, this indicates already that more than 3 trafﬁc phases are needed to appropriate
reﬂect the complexity of trafﬁc ﬂow phenomena. In fact, as the following section will show, one must distinguish sever
subclasses and special cases.

3.1.1. Several different kinds of ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”
In order to account for the empirical observations, ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” has been subdivided into a variety of differen

kinds, which undermines the concept of summarizing all states as ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” that are not classiﬁed as free trafﬁ
or wide moving jams.

For example, ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” was subdivided into three different kinds, based on observations of one-minute ave
ages measured at single cross-sections of the freeway (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996b):

1. ‘‘stationary and homogeneous states”, where both the average speed and the ﬂow rate are stationary for a few minutes
2. ‘‘homogeneous-in-speed states”, which look similar to the upper part of the free branch of the fundamental diagram (co

responding to a stationary average vehicle speed), but with a lower desired velocity (see also Kerner (1998b, 2004)),
3. ‘‘non-stationary and non-homogeneous states” (see also Kerner (1998b, 2004)).

Furthermore, it was suggested that, upstream of a bottleneck, ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” would bread wide moving jams base
on a ‘‘pinch effect” (Kerner, 1998a): upstream of a section with ‘‘synchronized” congested trafﬁc close to a bottleneck, a so
called ‘‘pinch region” would spontaneously give birth to narrow jams (vehicle clusters). These perturbations would be grow
ing while travelling further upstream. Eventually, wide moving jams would be formed by the merging or disappearance o

narrow jams. Once formed, wide jams would suppress the occurence of new narrow jams in between. Instead of forming
wide jams, however, narrow jams would be able to coexist, if their distance was larger than about 2.5 km (Kerner, 1998a).

3.1.2. Complications and inconsistencies with regard to the general pattern and the moving synchronized pattern
The congestion pattern related to the ‘‘pinch effect” is called ‘‘general pattern” (Kerner, 2002b). As the ‘‘general pattern”

consists of a spatial sequence of differently appearing kinds of congested trafﬁc ﬂow, the chosen terminology masks that
there may exist more than two congested trafﬁc states. It also makes it difﬁcult to decide when exactly a narrow jam born
in the ‘‘general pattern” becomes a ‘‘wide moving jam”. Without a clear classiﬁcation criterion, however, a distinction of the
two different congestion phases (‘‘wide moving jams” and ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”) becomes questionable.

Three-phase trafﬁc theory states that congestion patterns at isolated bottlenecks have the form of a ‘‘general pattern”
(Kerner, 2002a). Therefore, they should more or less look like the one displayed in Fig. 1. But the term ‘‘general pattern”
is also used for a large variety of congestion patterns of different appearance, e.g. ‘‘dissolving general patterns” (DGP), single
moving jams, and ‘‘AGP” (an alternation of free trafﬁc and ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”) (Kerner, 2002a,b). We doubt that such an
approach is useful for explaining the fundamentals and particularities of trafﬁc ﬂows.

Another congestion pattern that reveals serious classiﬁcation problems is the ‘‘moving synchronized pattern” (MSP). ‘‘Mov-
ing synchronized patterns” look like wide moving jams, but they are not, as they stop propagating at a bottleneck and form a
‘‘localized synchronized pattern”. ‘‘Moving synchronized patterns” often travel with the same speed as ‘‘wide moving jams”,
however, ‘‘... in contrast with a wide moving jam, if an MSP reaches a bottleneck, the MSP is caught at the bottleneck: the
MSP that propagates upstream can exist only for a ﬁnite time” (Kerner, 2005, p. 187). Furthermore, it is explicitly stated that
‘‘moving jams, which are caught at the bottleneck, are related to the synchronized ﬂow phase rather than to the wide moving

ig. 1. Representative example of the ‘‘pinch effect”. The underlying data are from the German freeway A5 in direction South. The solid arrow in this graph
ndicates the driving direction of vehicles. Upstream of intersection Bad Homburg at kilometer 481 (see Fig. 2), one can clearly see the typical spatial
equence characterizing a ‘‘general pattern”, i.e. an area of relatively stationary and homogeneous ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”, a ‘‘pinch region” in which
erturbations (narrow jams) occur, and ‘‘wide moving jams”, travelling through another congestion pattern upstream of junction Friedberg at kilometer
71. Note that the average vehicle speed in this diagram is displayed downwards for better illustration of the congestion pattern (see Section 3.2.1). For a

jam phase” (Kerner, 2007, p. 29). That is, the actual type of trafﬁc congestion indeed remains undeﬁned until it reaches the
next upstream bottleneck.

From our point of view, it is highly problematic to distinguish two identically looking states that cannot be told apart, if

788 M. Schönhof, D. Helbing / Transportation Research Part B 43 (2009) 784–797
there is no upstream bottleneck. Even if there were a bottleneck allowing one to differentiate between a MSP and a wide
moving jam, the ‘‘catching” of the jam and, thus, the identity of the trafﬁc phenomenon would probably depend on the bot-
tleneck strength, which leaves the classiﬁcation dissatisfactory. Thus, a clear identiﬁcation of a ‘‘wide moving jam” as op-
posed to ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” is not possible, and three-phase trafﬁc theory is severely questioned by this shortcoming. A
proposal to circumvent the problem is presented at the end of the next subsection.

3.1.3. Jam generation at off-ramps
Three-phase trafﬁc theory has particular problems explaining the observed transitions from free trafﬁc to moving jams,

without an intermediate transition to ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”. In the course of time, various interpretations of such empirical
ﬁndings have been suggested, but the formalization and critical testing of the proposed mechanisms is still not satisfactory:

1. On the one hand, the occurence of wide moving jams at off-ramps is explained as follows (Kerner, 2000a, 2004): jams
could only be generated in free trafﬁc, if ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” were suppressed by a suitable inhomogeneity of the free-
way such as an off-ramp with a large amount of cars leaving the freeway. (It is argued that the critical amplitude of a
density ﬂuctuation required for the generation of jams would be much bigger than for a transition to ‘‘synchronized
ﬂow”.) This explanation, however, lacks consistency: despite the mentioned suppression of synchronized ﬂow, ‘‘moving
synchronized patterns” (that are caught at the next bottleneck, see Section 3.1.2) are often generated at off-ramps, too.

2. On the other hand, even single jams generated upstream of an off-ramp are interpreted as a very short form of the ‘‘gen-
eral pattern” (Kerner, 2002b).

3. Finally, in some computer simulations, ‘‘wide moving jams” result from a ‘‘self-compression” of ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” in a
‘‘moving synchronized pattern” (Kerner and Klenov, 2002). This suggests a further, alternative interpretation of how wide
moving jams are generated at off-ramps.

In conclusion, there does not seem to be a consistent interpretation of transitions from free trafﬁc to wide moving jams. From
our point of view, the complexity of three-phase trafﬁc theory would considerably decrease,

� if one would drop the differentiation of moving jams into ‘‘moving synchronized patterns” and ‘‘wide moving jams”, and
� if one would consider the possibility of transitions from moving jams to other congestion patterns.

3.2. Empirical observations not sufﬁciently accounted for

The empirical studies, on which three-phase trafﬁc theory is based, have been mainly carried out for one freeway, namely
the German freeway A5 close to Frankfurt, and certain intersections of this freeway. However, observations from other sites
and rare or untypical observations have not been paid enough attention to, at least for a long time. This section will give
several examples of such other observations, as they have important implications for the interpretation of congestion pat-
terns and the development of a consistent trafﬁc theory (Helbing, forthcoming).

3.2.1. Remarks on trafﬁc data and analysis methods
Three-phase trafﬁc theory is mainly based on the study of trafﬁc on the German freeway A5 between 1996 and 2001 (see

Fig. 2). As these data were not provided to us, we have requested trafﬁc data for the same freeway stretch directly from the
responsible trafﬁc authorities and obtained extensive data sets for six months in 2001, cf. Schönhof and Helbing (2007).
Although the time period is different, it is unlikely that the driver behavior or trafﬁc dynamics has signiﬁcantly changed
on this freeway stretch. In fact, our empirical observations are largely consistent with the ones in the time period between
1996 and 2001, but some of our interpretations are different (see, for example, Section 3.2.2).

Our data analysis uses the ‘‘adaptive smoothing method” (Treiber and Helbing, 2002; Schönhof and Helbing, 2007), which
was applied in all three-dimensional representations throughout this paper. It averages out ﬂuctuations by means of a non-
isotropic smoothing method, taking the propagation direction of perturbations into account. In free trafﬁc, we set this speed
to the truck velocity of 80 km/h, while in congested trafﬁc, it was set to �16 km/h, i.e. the dissolution speed of congested
trafﬁc. Note that, for better illustration, the average vehicle velocities as a function of space and time are displayed upside
down in all three-dimensional diagrams of this paper, i.e. they increase in downward direction. This gives the velocity plots
an appearance similar to density plots, but has the advantage that the velocity can be determined much more accurately by
double loop detectors than the density. As a result, congested regions appear as ‘‘hills”, the size of which is indirectly related
to delays in travel time.2

2 A direct relation with travel time would be reached by displaying the inverse speed 1=V . However, this quantity can diverge, as V can go to zero within
trafﬁc jams.

Note that the adaptive smoothing method allows one to distinguish small vehicle clusters from ﬂuctuations. While ﬂuc-
tuations are averaged out, vehicle clusters cause perturbations that continue to exist while travelling forward, which makes
it possible to identify them. In this way, one can, for example, see the ﬁngerprints of long-lasting overtaking maneuvers of
trucks, which cause growing vehicle platoons behind them (Helbing and Tilch, submitted for publication). This will be dis-
cussed in the next section.

3.2.2. The ‘‘boomerang effect” as alternative jam generating mechanism
The mechanisms generating wide moving jams and the laws governing transitions to other trafﬁc states constitute key

elements of three-phase trafﬁc theory. According to the ‘‘pinch effect” (see Section 3.1.1), wide moving jams are born out
of a pinch region with ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”. A direct transition from free trafﬁc to moving jams is questioned, while it is pre-
dicted for large enough perturbations and suitable ﬂow conditions by the phase diagram of certain trafﬁc models with a fun-
damental diagram (Helbing et al., 1999) (see Section 4.2). In the following, we will show that such transitions from free ﬂow
to moving jams do actually exist, and that some of them result from overcritical perturbations generated by the heteroge-
neity of trafﬁc ﬂows (the fact that cars and trucks are driving at different speeds).

In our analysis of trafﬁc data of the German freeway A5, 18 out of 245 congestion patterns were initiated by a ‘‘boomerang
effect”. This effect also triggered ‘‘wide moving jams” several times (see Fig. 3). The ‘‘boomerang effect” is characterized by a

merang effect”. The upstream propagation sets in when the perturbation exceeds a certain amplitude (in terms of a drop in
the vehicle speed). This backward motion can be understood as follows: while inside of a trafﬁc jam vehicles are standing,
vehicles are leaving it at its downstream front, but new vehicles are joining the jam at its upstream front. Altogether, this
implies an upstream motion of the jam.

A closer investigation of the underlying data suggests that the ‘‘boomerang effect” relates to overtaking maneuvers of
trucks. These cause ‘‘moving bottlenecks” (Gazis and Herman, 1992; Munoz and Daganzo, 2002) at a speed of about
80 km/h. The change in the propagation direction occurs slightly upstream of a freeway intersection, where obstructive
interactions between the vehicle clusters and leaving vehicles occur. For an example of the triggering of congested trafﬁc
patterns by perturbations in free trafﬁc ﬂow see Fig. 4. The proper explanation of these observations requires3

1. to evaluate the truck fraction,
2. to consider overtaking maneuvers of trucks, and
3. to study the interaction of the resulting, growing vehicle platoon with a spatial inhomogeneity of the freeway (causing a

growth of the perturbation amplitude and a ‘‘turning of the boomerang”).

These factors have not been sufﬁciently accounted for in previous empirical studies of trafﬁc on the German freeway A5
close to Frankfurt and in the development of trafﬁc theories based on these data. Therefore, alternative explanations have not
been well enough considered.

3 At least this holds, if cars and trucks have different speed limits, as on German freeways.

3.2.3. ‘‘General Patterns” are not general
While the term ‘‘general pattern” is used in a very ﬂexible way, as it accounts for many differently appearing congestion

patterns (see Section 3.1.2), there are still other trafﬁc patterns, that are not well covered by the concept of the ‘‘general
pattern”. Fig. 5 shows two examples. From this ﬁgure it is obvious that congestion patterns at ﬂow-conserving bottlenecks
look different from congestion patterns at freeway intersections (see Figs. 1 and 3a).

Fig. 5a shows an example of an oscillatory congested trafﬁc pattern at an isolated and spatially conﬁned bottleneck. It
is caused by an accident a kilometer 478.325 at 9:50am. In comparison with the ‘‘general pattern” in Fig. 1, the forma-
tion of narrow jams starts directly upstream of the isolated bottleneck (the accident site), rather than after a region of
stationary and homogeneous ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”.4 Moreover, the dissolution or merging of jams still continues seven
kilometer upstream of the bottleneck. As the jams do not pass the intersection Friedberg at kilometer 471, one cannot clas-
sify the pronounced stop-and-go waves as ‘‘wide moving jams”. Hence, the characteristic spatial structure of a ‘‘general
pattern” (‘‘synchronized ﬂow”, ‘‘pinch region” with jam formation, and a region of ‘‘wide moving jams”) cannot be seen
here.

Fig. 5b shows that ‘‘wide moving jams” as well can be born at gradients without the previous transition to synchronized
ﬂow. Interpreting them as a ‘‘moving synchronized patterns”, which transform into ‘‘wide moving jams” by ‘‘self-compres-
sion” (Kerner and Klenov, 2002) would formally circumvent the problem. However, this is certainly not a satisfactory solu-

Fig. 3. Formation of wide moving jams. The spatio-temporal trafﬁc patterns show the average velocity in downward direction for the sake of better
illustration (see Section 3.2.1 for details). (a) Example of a wide moving jam triggered by a ‘‘boomerang effect” at kilometer 488 around 7am, without the
previous existence of ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”. The solid arrows indicate the driving direction. For details of the observed section of the German freeway A5 see
Fig. 2. (b) Another example of a wide moving jam born by a ‘‘boomerang” effect occurring at the same location. As in (a), ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” is triggered
upstream of the intersection Bad Homburg at kilometer 481, when the wide moving jam passes the freeway intersection. In contrast to (a), no pinch effect is
visible in (b) upstream of kilometer 481. According to three-phase trafﬁc theory, however, there should be a transition from free trafﬁc to ‘‘synchronized
ﬂow” and then to ‘‘wide moving jams”. For the further discussion of similar trafﬁc patterns see Schönhof and Helbing (2007).
tion, as this would fundamentally question the deﬁnition and existence of a separate trafﬁc phase of ‘‘wide moving jams”. A
simpler interpretation would be based on the phase diagram (see Section 4.2), considering the instability of trafﬁc ﬂow in a
certain density regime.

We suggest that, in contrast to the congestion patterns at isolated bottlenecks (see Fig. 5), ‘‘general patterns” are actually
speciﬁc patterns resulting at freeway sections with an on-ramp and an off-ramp further upstream. Then, it is natural to inter-
pret a ‘‘general pattern” as a combination of different kinds of congestion along the freeway (Schönhof and Helbing, 2007):

1. a spatially extended form of congested trafﬁc between the on-ramp and the off-ramp, which may be considered as ‘‘syn-
chronized ﬂow”,

2. less serious congestion such as stop-and-go waves upstream of the off-ramp, where the bottleneck strength is reduced (as
vehicles leaving the freeway free up some capacity), and

3. a special kind of congestion and dynamics in the vicinity of the off-ramp section (which relates to drivers who leave the
freeway in response to congestion downstream of the off-ramp and, thereby, determine the particular features of the
‘‘pinch region”).

Certainly, we have to contradict the claim that ‘‘the effective bottleneck at (cross-section) D6 (here named S6, see Fig. 2) can
indeed be considered as an isolated bottleneck at the on ramp” (Kerner, 2002b).

4 A similar observation has been made at a factually isolated on-ramp, merging with an inner urban freeway next to the public observation tower in Kairo.
The videos displayed at http://www.trafﬁcforum.org/stopandgo were recorded under free ﬂow conditions downstream of the on-ramp. Nevertheless, the on-
ramp reproducibly triggered the breakdown of trafﬁc ﬂow and the emergence of upstream moving stop-and-go waves. Qualitatively very similar trafﬁc
patterns are generated by the microscopic trafﬁc simulations available at http://www.trafﬁc-simulation.de/.

3.2.4. Existence of homogeneous congested trafﬁc
According to three-phase trafﬁc theory, the area of congested ﬂow–density data is not further subdivided into areas of

different stability. All feasible states are rather postulated to be metastable (Kerner, 1998b). In contrast to this, many trafﬁc
models predict the existence of areas of unstable, metastable and stable congested trafﬁc ﬂows (Helbing, 2001), see Section
4.2. Accordingly, there should be a stable trafﬁc regime at high density, implying the existence of ‘‘homogeneous congested
trafﬁc” (Helbing et al., 1999). This, however, is incompatible with three-phase trafﬁc theory.

Homogeneous congested trafﬁc is deﬁned as a form of congested trafﬁc with a considerable spatial extension (typically
larger than that of a wide moving jam), which may grow or shrink. The downstream front is usually located at a bottleneck.
Vehicles in homogeneous congested trafﬁc have a slow, but not necessarily zero speed. Applying some spatial and temporal
smoothing, the average speed appears to be homogeneous, i.e. it is not of a pronounced oscillatory nature, in contrast, for
example, to the ‘‘pinch effect”.

Fig. 4. Illustration of the ‘‘boomerang effect”. A detailed analysis of the trafﬁc scenario in Fig. 3b shows that the ‘‘boomerang effect” starts with a peak in the
truck fraction, which moves in travel direction at a velocity of about 75 km/h, see also Schönhof and Helbing (2007). The movement of the peak is illustrated
by the solid arrow. After the peak, high ﬂow values and a reduction in the average vehicle speed can be observed for some time period (see the part of the
time series marked by the circles). This indicates a dense vehicle cluster queuing up behind overtaking trucks. While the cluster moves forward, its spatial
extension grows: the time period, during which the vehicle velocity V is reduced, increases from one measurement cross-section to the next. Approximately
one kilometer before the off-ramp at intersection Frankfurt North-West, which is characterized by many lane changing maneuvers due to a high off-ramp
ﬂow, the velocity drops to values around 60 km/h. This causes a trafﬁc jam travelling against the driving direction (dashed arrow). The reduction in the
average speed and ﬂow now increases with time, thereby causing a growth in the amplitude of perturbation.

When studying empirical data, we did not observe any widely extended homogeneous congested trafﬁc states upstream
of freeway intersections. However, one would not expect to ﬁnd them over there, as the freeway would otherwise be inap-
propriately dimensioned. In contrast, homogeneous congested trafﬁc states were observed after serious accidents with lane
closures (see Fig. 6). Such states require large bottleneck strengths exceeding about 700 vehicles per hour and lane (Schönhof
and Helbing, 2007). That is, if cases of accidents are excluded from the data set, it is unlikely to ﬁnd examples of homoge-
neous congested trafﬁc.

We are aware that some inhomogeneity in the trafﬁc ﬂows results from the following effects: (i) random variations in the
time gaps of vehicles (see Section 4.1), (ii) entering or leaving vehicles at freeway junctions or ramps, or related lane-changes
upstream or downstream of them, (iii) difﬁculties in smoothly controlling the gas pedal at low speeds. However, the authors
of this paper do not think that these effects of ﬂuctuations and heterogeneities in driver–vehicle behavior would be funda-
mental properties of trafﬁc ﬂows that require a detailed theoretical description. For this reason, the adaptive smoothing
method (ASM) has been used to separate noise effects from the systematic dynamics, using the same parameters for all con-
gestion patterns. Hence, the difference between oscillating and homogeneous congested trafﬁc is not a matter of differently
chosen smoothing parameters, but it must be due to a different spatio-temporal dynamics.

4. Revisiting the criticism of trafﬁc models that are not based on three-phase trafﬁc theory

4.1. Wide scattering as effect of heterogeneous trafﬁc

depicted in Fig. 2, the video at http://www.trafﬁcforum.org/stopandgo, and Schönhof and Helbing (2007). The driving direction is again indicated by solid
arrows. (a) Moving jams triggered by an accident at kilometer 478.325 at 9:50am. (b) Wide moving jams appearing from 14:30 to 16:10 at the uphill
gradient between kilometer 475 and kilometer 477 (see Fig. 2). The interruption of some jams at 16:20 is caused by an accident at kilometer 482.8. The
‘‘wide moving jams” disappear at intersection Frankfurt West due to several off-ramps, but before they pass the congested trafﬁc upstream of the
intersection Frankfurt North-West at kilometer 489. Note that the vehicle velocities in these diagrams increase in downward direction, see Section 3.2.1.
Three-phase trafﬁc theory suggests that classical trafﬁc models with a fundamental diagram would not be able to repro-
duce the wide scattering of congested ﬂow–density data. This, however, mainly applies to models assuming identical driver-
vehicle units. Already the consideration of two kinds of vehicles, cars and trucks, allows one to reproduce empirical ﬂow–
density diagrams semi-quantitatively, even with a simple macroscopic trafﬁc model (Treiber and Helbing, 1999).

Fig. 6. Representative example of homogeneous congested trafﬁc. The trafﬁc pattern is caused by an accident with a blockage of freeway lanes, cf. Schönhof
and Helbing (2007). The vehicle velocities in the diagram increase in downward direction for better illustration of the congestion pattern (cf. Section 3.2.1.).




Moreover, empirical data are quantitatively compatible with the simple relationship

for the ﬂow Q, known as ‘‘jam line” (Kerner and Rehborn, 1996a), if not only the temporal variation of the density q is con-
sidered, but also the temporal variation of the average time gap T and the jam density qjam (Nishinari et al., 2003). In such a
case, the changes in the ﬂow according to Eq. (1) have a surprisingly high correlation of more than 90% with the changes in
the empirical ﬂows. The scattering is mainly due to different behaviors of cars and trucks, with a large variation of the truck
fraction. However, some amount of scattering also originates from inter-driver and intra-driver variability (Wagner et al.,
1996; Hoogendoorn and Bovy, 1998), and from the aggregation by the measurement process (Treiber and Helbing, 2003).

Note that the time gaps are widely distributed with a heavy tail. Therefore, they average poorly with the time interval of
data aggregation or sampling size (Nishinari et al., 2003). This implies a large temporal variation of the average time gaps T,
which is of particular importance, as it leads to a varying slope �1=ðqjamTÞ of the jam line (Banks, 1999). Hence, variations in
the average time gap T and the density q lead to movements in the ﬂow–density-plane, which point into different directions,
if trafﬁc ﬂow is congested. In free ﬂow, however, variations of q and T lead to collinear movements. Altogether this explains
both, the area of widely scattered ﬂow–density data in the congested regime and the almost one-dimensional relationship
for free trafﬁc ﬂow.

In summary, the wide scattering of congested ﬂow–density data is not well compatible with models assuming identical
vehicle behavior, but it is consistent with multi-class models assuming heterogeneous driver–vehicle units. This holds even
for macroscopic multi-class models with a fundamental diagram for each vehicle class (Treiber and Helbing, 1999).

Fig. 7. Phase diagrams of ﬂow-dependent trafﬁc patterns and underlying instability diagrams for a model of freeway trafﬁc with a fundamental diagram.
The stable, linearly unstable, and metastable (grey) density areas are illustrated (a) in the velocity–density diagram and (b) in the ﬂow–density diagram.
While perturbations of any size are damped out in the stable areas and even small perturbations grow in the linearly unstable area, the outcome in the
metastable regime (grey area) depends on whether the perturbation size is above or below a critical threshold (i.e. large perturbations grow, while small
ones eventually disappear). The lower ﬁgures show a schematic representation of the idealized phase diagram of trafﬁc states assuming (c) negligible and
(d) large perturbations of the trafﬁc ﬂow. The diagrams are for an on-ramp ﬂow merging into the freeway ﬂow, but an application to other kinds of
bottlenecks is possible as well (Treiber et al., 2000). The different areas indicate, for which combinations of the upstream freeway ﬂow Qup and the ramp
ﬂow DQ certain trafﬁc states can exist. The sum of both ﬂows determines the total trafﬁc demand Q tot. According to our understanding, ‘‘extended
congested trafﬁc” can be classiﬁed as ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”. Single ‘‘wide moving jams” triggered by large perturbations fall into the upper triangular subarea



1999, submitted for publication).

794 M. Schönhof, D. Helbing / Transportation Research Part B 43 (2009) 784–797
The concept of the phase diagram also helps to categorize microscopic (Kerner and Klenov, 2003) and macroscopic trafﬁc
models (Lee et al., 1999) into different classes, depending on the number and kinds of congested trafﬁc states they imply
(Helbing, 2001; Helbing et al., submitted for publication). From our point of view, the phase diagrams of models based on
three-phase trafﬁc theory (Kerner and Klenov, 2003) differ from the original one found for the gas-kinetic-based trafﬁc mod-
el (Helbing et al., 1999) mainly by the existence of an additional area, in which so-called ‘‘widening synchronized patterns”
occur, and beyond this in the use of terminology: when identifying extended congested trafﬁc ﬂowwith ‘‘synchronized ﬂow”
and moving localized clusters with moving synchronized patterns, the result is a high degree of qualitative similarity (Tre-
iber et al., submitted for publication).

An idealized phase diagram of the intelligent driver model for a particular choice of parameters (Helbing et al., submitted
for publication) is presented in Fig. 7c and d. Given suitable instability properties, the corresponding phase diagram is well
consistent with empirical observations (Schönhof and Helbing, 2007; Helbing et al., submitted for publication). It also con-
tains an area, where ‘‘widening synchronized patterns” can appear (Helbing et al., submitted for publication).

Due to the metastability of trafﬁc ﬂows, one needs to distinguish between a phase diagram for small perturbations in the
trafﬁc ﬂow (see Fig. 7c) and one for large perturbations (see Fig. 7d). Apart from the area of WSP states, in which so-called
widening synchronized patterns can occur, the latter corresponds essentially to the one presented in the original publication
(Helbing et al., 1999). This distinction of perturbation sizes is important from a theoretical point of view, when transitions
between different trafﬁc states are discussed. However, as the perturbation size is empirically hard to determine, it is advised
to compare empirical observations with a superposition of the two phase diagrams Fig. 7c and d.

The ﬁrst proposed phase diagram (Helbing et al., 1999), which corresponds to Fig. 7d, but without the WSP area, and the
underlying ‘‘fundamental diagram approach” have been critisized to contradict basic empirical observations for the follow-
ing reasons (Kerner, 2002a):

1. Homogeneous congested trafﬁc would not exist for large bottleneck strengths.
2. When the total trafﬁc demand is increased, a transition from free trafﬁc to moving jams should occur before the transition

to extended forms of congested trafﬁc, while most moving jams have been observed after a previous transition to ‘‘syn-
chronized ﬂow”.

3. When the total trafﬁc demand goes down, the transition from extended congested trafﬁc to free trafﬁc would require the
intermediate occurence of a localized cluster, which is normally not observed.

In Section 3.2.4, it has been already shown that the ﬁrst criticism is wrong.
The second and third claim are based on the phase diagram for large perturbations, which is depicted in Fig. 7d. Note,

however, that the phase diagram looks different for small perturbations (see Fig. 7c). According to it, a direct transition from
free ﬂow to an extended form of congested trafﬁc is expected, as soon as the total trafﬁc volume Qup þ DQ exceeds a certain
threshold. That is, direct transitions from free trafﬁc to ‘‘synchronized ﬂow” should actually be common, in agreement with
observations. While transitions to multiple moving jams are possible for small perturbations (Schönhof and Helbing, 2007),
transitions to localized clusters (e.g. to single moving jams) require large perturbations (see Fig. 7c and d). Note that this
holds for single, isolated bottlenecks, while congestion patterns reminding of localized clusters can also occur between
on-ramps and upstream off-ramps (Schönhof and Helbing, 2007).

Furthermore, during the transition from extended congested trafﬁc to free trafﬁc, an intermediate localized cluster state
will normally not occur. This is, because the total trafﬁc demand has usually moved into the region of free trafﬁc already
before the extended congested trafﬁc has melted down to the size of a localized cluster.

In conclusion, the above criticisms of phase diagrams for trafﬁc models with a fundamental diagram are based on mis-
understandings. The phase diagram is, in fact, very well consistent with empirical observations (Schönhof and Helbing,
2007; Helbing et al., submitted for publication).

5. Summary and outlook

In this paper, we have questioned three-phase trafﬁc theory based on empirical data from the German freeway A5 close to
Frankfurt. Most of the observations, which triggered the development of three-phase trafﬁc theory, stem from this freeway
stretch. While we have a high opinion of many fundamental discoveries within the context of three-phase trafﬁc theory, we
do not agree with a number of interpretations that went along with these discoveries, as will be summarized in the
following:
4.2. The phase diagram of trafﬁc models with a ‘‘fundamental diagram” and its misinterpretation

The phase diagram of trafﬁc states is a general concept, which makes quantitative predictions: it offers a systematic cat-
egorization of the variety of congested trafﬁc states and provides an explanation for them (Helbing et al., 1999). In addition,
for models with a fundamental diagram (characterized by a one-dimensional and unique ﬂow–density relationship in the
stationary and homogeneous case), it allows one to derive conditions for the possible existence of these states, based on
the instability regimes of trafﬁc ﬂows and the self-organized, characteristic outﬂow from congested trafﬁc (Helbing et al.,



M. Schönhof, D. Helbing / Transportation Research Part B 43 (2009) 784–797 795
fore, it is not always clear, which conclusions follow from models and which ones from empirical data.

5.2. Challenges for trafﬁc modeling

In our opinion, it causes theoretical problems to separate ‘‘wide moving jams” from ‘‘moving synchronized patterns” as
deﬁned by three-phase trafﬁc theory. We propose to consider them both as moving jams or ‘‘moving localized clusters”. One
1. Particularly with respect to the ‘‘moving synchronized pattern”, but also with respect to the transition from ‘‘synchro-
nized ﬂow” to ‘‘wide moving jams” in the ‘‘general pattern”, the classiﬁcation of trafﬁc states in three-phase trafﬁc theory
is not well deﬁned and remains qualitative, i.e. mostly non-predictive.

2. The ‘‘general pattern” is most likely a consequence of the combination of one or several on-ramps with one or several off-
ramps further upstream, i.e. a result of a particular freeway design. Congestion patterns at ﬂow-conserving bottlenecks
have a different appearance.

5.1. Methodological concerns

We see the source of our disagreement with several interpretations of three-phase trafﬁc theory in some methodological
shortcomings of previous empirical studies:

� The impact of accident-induced bottlenecks on the kind of congestion has not been sufﬁciently discussed. In fact, within
half a year, there were about 500 accidents or breakdowns of vehicles on the freeway stretch investigated by us. While
most of them had a minor impact on the trafﬁc dynamics, some accidents caused major lane blockages. Together with
a high trafﬁc volume, such blockages were the precondition for the observation of homogeneous congested trafﬁc states,
which should not exist according to three-phase trafﬁc theory.

� The impact of gradients (see Fig. 2), which can constitute ﬂow-conserving bottlenecks, has been neglected. At such bot-
tlenecks, we have observed congested trafﬁc patterns that look different from ‘‘general patterns” (Schönhof and Helbing,
2007). In fact, they often show direct transitions from free trafﬁc to moving jams.

� Complex multi-ramp setups (see Fig. 2) have been generalized to arbitrary bottleneck situations and compared with mod-
els for simple on-ramp scenarios. As these models were not developed for such scenarios, they could not reproduce ‘‘gen-
eral patterns” well, but those can be easily be understood as effect of the particular freeway design (see Section 3.2.3).

� The inﬂuence of the truck fraction has not been accounted for. It is actually one important factor for the wide scattering of
ﬂow–density data in the congested trafﬁc regime (Treiber and Helbing, 1999). Moreover, overtaking maneuvers of trucks
seem to be responsible for the boomerang effect, which can trigger direct transitions from free trafﬁc to moving jams (see
Section 3.2.2).

� The relevance of the perturbation size for the transition from free trafﬁc to particular kinds of congested trafﬁc has not
been properly taken into account (see Section 3.2.2). This has important implications for the comparison between trafﬁc
theories and empirical data (see Section 4.2), in particular with respect to the expected transitions between different traf-
ﬁc states.

� Empirical cross-sectional, time-averaged measurements for multi-class and multi-lane trafﬁc have been compared with
effective one-lanemodels for identical vehicles andwithout consideration of themeasurementmethod. The resulting devi-
ation between empirical and simulation results was interpreted as failure of models assuming a fundamental diagram of
trafﬁc ﬂows. However, if the heterogeneity of trafﬁc ﬂows is adequately taken into account, observations like thewide scat-
tering of congested ﬂow–density data can, in fact, be well reproduced by simulation models (Treiber and Helbing, 1999).

� The impact of the adaptive speed control system along the studied freeway has not been discussed. This control system
could, for example, be responsible for the existence of spatially extended ‘‘homogeneous-in-speed states” (cf. Kerner,
2004, pp. 298 and356): these tend to occur when the overall ﬂow in the three freeway lanes reaches stable values around
6000 vehicles per hour. Note that, in Germany, intelligent speed control systems usually display a speed limit of 80 km/h,
when a value of 5400 vehicles per hour is exceeded (MARZ, 1999).

� The inﬂuence of the weather conditions on the vehicle ﬂows, in particular the outﬂow from congested trafﬁc, has not been
sufﬁciently studied. According to recent empirical results, however, the variability of the outﬂow Qout from congested traf-
ﬁc can at least partially be explained by the weather conditions (Schönhof, in press; Helbing et al., submitted for publi-
cation). Taking this variability into account, one ﬁnds a good agreement between theoretical and empirical phase
diagrams (Schönhof and Helbing, 2007; Helbing et al., submitted for publication).

Considering the mentioned shortcomings, we conclude that some of the interpretations of three-phase trafﬁc theory could
be replaced by simpler interpretations (Helbing, forthcoming), as elaborated above. Nevertheless, there are attempts to
reproduce the interpretations of three-phase trafﬁc theory by parameter-rich microsimulation models, namely a continuous
microscopic model (Kerner and Klenov, 2002, 2003) and a stochastic cellular automaton (Kerner et al., 2002). These models
explicitly implement the hypothesis regarding the existence of metastable stationary and homogeneous ‘‘synchronized
ﬂows” in a wide area of the ﬂow–density diagram. Since the simulated congestion patterns were named after the empirical
ones, statements about simulated congestion patterns are now hard to distinguish from empirically based statements. There-



Until today, there is not only a lack of sufﬁciently detailed models of the trafﬁc dynamics at freeway intersections. There is

also a need of more detailed empirical data. In order to ﬁnally decide which trafﬁc model provides the best description and
what is the true cause of the spatio-temporal organization of the ‘‘general pattern”, it is necessary to have spatio-temporal
data of single vehicles and their lane-changing behavior. Such data require to determine trajectory data along freeway inter-
sections by means of special, video-equipped helicopters. While studies of this kind are expensive and technologically
demanding, they will be needed to shed more light on the oldest and most central question of trafﬁc theory, namely what
are the real mechanisms and quantitative properties of trafﬁc breakdowns.

would then have to accept that the ‘‘characteristic constants” are actually only constants for ‘‘wide moving jams”, i.e. in a
limiting case or, in other words, under idealized conditions. Generally, the propagation speed and other characteristic con-
stants of ‘‘wide moving jams” could vary for moving localized clusters. Such an approach would remove some of the theo-
retical inconsistencies of three-phase trafﬁc theory.

However, our empirical observations do not only challenge three-phase trafﬁc theory, but also other theories. For example,
it needs to be checked whether current multi-class simulation models reproduce the empirical features of the ‘‘boomerang
effect”, i.e.

� the growth of the spatial extension (width) of small perturbations, while they are travelling forward,
� the turning of the propagation direction slightly upstream of the off-ramp of a freeway intersection, and
� the subsequent growth of the perturbation amplitude.

Furthermore, while the original phase diagram approach (Helbing et al., 1999; Helbing et al., submitted for publication) pro-
vides a promising alternative to three-phase trafﬁc theory, in order to reach a quantitative agreement with empirical ﬁndings,
the upstream ﬂows and ramp ﬂows must be scaled by the respective outﬂow Qout from congested trafﬁc (Schönhof and Hel-
bing, 2007). In contrast to many trafﬁc models, the empirical outﬂows are varying considerably from day to day (Kerner,
2000b; Schönhof and Helbing, 2007), but this does not seem to be a sheer consequence of the varying truck fraction. The
variation is also not just an effect of the statistical variation of congested ﬂow–density data, as there is a systematic corre-
lation of the outﬂow with the average vehicle speed in the congested area, and with the on- and off-ramp ﬂows (Schönhof
and Helbing, 2007). We believe that this calls for suitable microscopic multi-class trafﬁc models considering the lane and
route choice of driver–vehicle units. Moreover, the desired speed (or speed limit) is expected to have a systematic inﬂuence
on the value of the outﬂow (Helbing et al., 2007). Therefore, the weather conditions should inﬂuence the outﬂow as well,
which has recently been conﬁrmed by empirical data (Schönhof, in press; Helbing et al., submitted for publication).
