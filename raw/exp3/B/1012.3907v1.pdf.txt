Abstract

Spatio-temporal correlations of intensity of traffic are analysed for one

week data collected in the motorway M-30 around Madrid in January

2009. We found that the lifetime of these correlations is the shortest in

the evening, between 6 and 8 p.m. This lifetime is a new indicator how

much attention of drivers is demanded in given traffic conditions.

1 Introduction

As an interdisciplinary application of statistical physics, physics of traffic is not
new. As several problems posed there remain to be solved, the topic is far from
being exhausted. One of central questions is how traffic jams arise, with another
question - how to control the jams - in the context. Around these issues, a lot
of modelling approaches have been proposed [1, 2, 3, 4], from partial differential
equations to cellular automata. As a rule, two phases of traffic are discussed:
free flow and jam. Apart from these two, a synchronized phase has been dis-
tinguished [5, 6]. Later, the concept was criticized as ambiguous [7]. According
to this critique the effect when vehicles move ”nearly synchronized in different
lanes of the highway” [5] appears in qualitatively different states and therefore it
cannot be treated as a criterion of a specific phase. Still, the synchronization as
an effect (not a phase) has been frequently called in [8, 9, 10, 11]. In particular,
two synchronized modes of traffic have been distinguished in [10]: lightly and
heavily congested traffic.

Our concern here is devoted to the lifetime of spatial configurations of moving
vehicles. The motivation is, most briefly, that these lifetimes give information on
the rates of transitions of the traffic system from one state to another. Specific
configurations of vehicles with their velocities can be treated as microscopic
states. This kind of data is hardly available; more often coarse-grained data
are collected as intensities A averaged over some time periods, 30 seconds at
best. From readings A1(t) and A2(t) collected with two sensors 1, 2 of distance
x one from another, we evaluate the time average of the correlation of A1(t)
with A2(t+ τ). Once the coarse-grained state changes only slightly in time, the
correlation should show a maximum at the delay τ = x/v, where v is the mean
velocity of vehicles. Further, the velocity spread of vehicles is expected to lead

1




to a finite length of spatial correlations of A. The latter rescaled again by v is a
measure of lifetime of the coarse-grained states. An obvious shortcoming of this
procedure is that the time of measurement (1 minute) is not commensurate with
the mean time x/v of motion of vehicles from one sensor to another. However,
this difficulty can be evaded at least partially by averaging over more pairs of
sensors.

The lifetime seems to be a new tool, and in particular we are not aware
about any research on the spatio-temporal correlations of traffic flow. In [12],
the autocorrelation was investigated of the local density, the average velocity
and the flow for the free-flow, synchronized and congested phases. The autocor-
relation functions measured with one sensor showed a slow decrease of density
and flow in the free flow state, and much quicker decrease in the synchronized
state, while in the congested (stop-and-go) state, the autocorrelation functions
oscillate in time (Figs. 10 and 12 in [12]). According to [6], the sequence of
phases from free flow to jammed phase is through the synchronized phase. On
the other hand, an exemplary time series with a transition from the free flow
to the congested phase, shown in [12] (Fig. 13), show a sharp character of the
transition, with only momentary increase of the variance of velocity. Both the
short time of the transition and the short timescale of the autocorrelation func-
tions can be due to the metastable character of the synchronized state. The
data on the lifetime should provide information how quickly the traffic states
change.

In the next section we give the details on our traffic data. Two subsequent
sections are devoted to the details of the calculation and to the numerical re-
sults. Last section contains our conclusions.

2 Data

The data are collected from 1-minute aggregated readings of 24 sets of sensors
or measurement points- placed along a 13 km-length road stretch of the M30
motorway that surrounds the center of Madrid. Data sets cover a period of one
week readings, between January 26th and February 1st, 2009. These real traffic
datasets provided by the detectors include (i) counting of vehicles; (ii) intensity
or flow of traffic (vehicles/h); (iii) traffic density (vehicles/km); (iv) occupancy
data (time that the sensor is detecting the presence of a vehicle); (v) real time
vehicle speed (km/h); and (vi) vehicle length and classification by categories
(car, bus, van, truck, etc.). A detailed description of the data can be found in
[13].

Real world traffic data sets from M30 motorway have been measured by a
detection system based on inductive loops; these inductive sensors are used in
detection systems that rely on the principle that a moving magnet a vehicle-
will induce an electrical current in a nearby conducting wire, fact that is applied
for the detection of vehicle presence indicators and thus for getting information
of real traffic data. The base of these vehicle detection systems is the detection
of the induction change when a metallic mass a vehicle- passes through a loop

installed under the road pavement. The loop forms part of circuits that oscillate
to a determined frequency that is changed by the variations of the loops induc-
tance as the metallic mass passes through it. Then the detector will translate
that physical reality (the presence of a vehicle) into an electrical signal that
will be processed afterwards by a microprocessor that will digitally treat the
obtained inputs transmitted by the induction loops so as to obtain real traffic
data. Detectors can aggregate real data upon different time basis. In the case
of the M30 motorway detection system, traffic data are aggregated on 1-minute
integration period basis.

Inductive loops-based detectors are considered as most accurate electronic
devices for vehicle detection; they are normally used in traffic detection due to
their high robustness and reliability, their low sensitivity to adverse meteoro-
logical conditions and their low cost. Therefore, the probability of erroneous
vehicle sensing is very low, although they can also suffer from shifts in their
reference frequency, mainly due to big thermal changes in the pavement, and
from possible breaks or wire short-circuits.

3 Calculations

At the beginning, the fundamental diagram of the data is constructed. This
diagram express the intensity of traffic as a function of vehicles density. The
density is calculated from the data as a quotient of intensity A and velocity v

at each time point.

For the remaining analysis, the curve showing the dependence of the num-
ber of vehicles as a function of time is subjected to detrendisation [14]. This
procedure is performed as follows: For each sensor and day the whole data set
is divided into one hour long subsets. Each subset is fitted by a cubic function,
using the ”least square method.” Subsequently, from each measured value, a
value calculated on the basis of parameters obtained from the fitting procedure
is subtracted. The procedure is applied if the amount of data in a given time
period is higher than the number of parameters of the function used for fitting.
Data prepared in this way is used in further analysis.

We estimate the travel time between each pair of sensors (si, sj), on the basis
of the distance between them and the average velocity of the vehicles on the
given portion of the road. After the estimated time, the same vehicles which
are detected near the sensor si should appear near the sensor sj. Taking into
account this time shift τ , the Pearson correlation coefficient c, between a given
pair of sensors, is calculated:

- average value. Obtained values cij lie in the range [−1, 1], where −1 - means
full anti-correlation, 0 - lack of correlation, and 1 - full correlation. Each value
is averaged with all other values obtained in the following half-hour.

As it is visible in the data, and what is intuitively understandable, observed
traffic data is different on workdays and weekends. Because of that, in further
calculation only data from workdays was taken into account. For all pairs of
sensors and time periods, obtained values of the correlation coefficients are aver-
aged over workdays. Collecting all obtained data for half-hour periods of time,
we obtain a curve which shows how the correlation coefficient depends on the
distance between sensors. Fitting this curve by a function f(x) = λ exp(−x/ξ)
we obtain a correlation length ξ for each period of time.

4 Results

In Fig.1 we show the fundamental diagram of the collected data. The overall
character of the obtained plot is similar to the fundamental diagrams reported
in literature [1, 2, 3]. The flow intensity against time, is shown in Fig.2. The
data show that the character of the curve is the same for all working days, see
also the plots in [13]. In Fig.3 we show the velocity and its standard deviation,
averaged over 30 minutes. As we see, low velocity is correlated with its large

variance.

In Figs. 4 and 5, the plots show the data on the correlation coefficient C.
These results collected for all pairs of sensors are averaged over workdays and
fitted to see the distance dependence of f(d) = λ exp(−d/ξ). The value of the
obtained correlation length ξ is 3.4 km for the readings between 4 and 4.30 a.m.,
and 0.21 km between 6 and 6.30 p.m.

Fig. 6 shows the data on the lifetime τ of the spatial configurations, defined
as τ = ξ/ < v >. It is remarkable that the increase of the intensity A of
the flow between 6 and 8 a.m. and the minimum of the velocity < v > at 8
a.m. accompanied with sharp maximum of the velocity standard deviation σ
influence the lifetime τ only slightly. Another fall of v after 3 p.m. with even
sharper peak of σ can be correlated with irregularities of the lifetime τ . It is
between 6 and 8 p.m. where we observe a qualitative drop of the lifetime τ .
Simultaneously, the velocity standard deviation σ gets a daily maximum of 25
km/h, as shown in Fig. 3.

5 Discussion

As it follows from our results, the data collected between 6 and 8 p.m. describe
states with the lowest mean velocity < v > and the shortest lifetime τ . In
the same area, the velocity variance σ is the largest. This finding is of inter-

est because of the notion, that the velocity variance shows a maximum at the
transition between the flow phase and the congested phase. It was stated in
[12], that the existence of this maximum is a numerical artifact of an appear-
ance of two different phases within the same time interval. Our interpretation
is that the large velocity variance marks a series of relatively rapid changes be-
tween different spatial configurations of vehicles. Such a behaviour is perhaps
more specific for traffic than an unstable synchronized state. The short lifetime
seems to be an apt characteristics of the varying state. It would be desirable
to evaluate it also for traffic systems without ramps, where the dynamics is not
influenced by external sources or sinks.

According to the statistics provided by the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety, it is between 5 and 7 p.m. when most people are killed in road acci-
dents [15]. As we have seen in the presented data, the road conditions in these
hours are: the largest traffic intensity, moderate mean velocity and the largest
velocity variance. As noted above, the latter quantity is expected to be low
in a synchronized phase of any kind, and - what is obvious - in the congested
phase. The fact that between 6 and 8 p.m. the traffic configurations, as seen
by drivers, change most quickly, can contribute to the deadly statistics, as these
quick changes demand for the drivers’ highest attention. It is likely that the
lifetime proposed here provides a criterion of evaluation and identification of
potentially dangerous traffic states.

Finally the lifetimes of particular traffic states, when handled within the-

ory of diffusion on networks [16], can be converted into rates of variations of
time-dependent probabilities of microscopic and coarse-grained states of com-
plex systems. This kind of modelling, proposed recently in [17], seems to us
particularly promising in applications to complex systems.
