We address the controversial issue of trafﬁc ﬂow modeling, whether ﬁrst-order, second-order, or othertrafﬁc models are best supported by empirical facts and theoretical considerations. This is done by a
critical discussion of the pros and cons of the different theoretical approaches and by the analysis of a large
set of empirical data with new evaluation techniques. Speciﬁcally, we investigate characteristic properties of the
congested trafﬁc states on a 30-km-long stretch of the German freeway A5 near Frankfurt/Main. Among the
approximately 245 breakdowns of trafﬁc ﬂow at several different bottlenecks in 165 days, we have identiﬁed ﬁve
different kinds of spatiotemporal congestion patterns and their combinations. Based on an “adaptive smoothing
method” for the visualization of detector data, we also discuss particular features of breakdowns, such as signs
of unstable trafﬁc ﬂow and the “boomerang effect,” which often seems to be caused by overtaking maneuvers
of trucks. Controversial issues such as “synchronized ﬂow” or stop-and-go waves are addressed as well. Our
empirical results are compared with the implications of different theoretical concepts such as ﬁrst-order trafﬁc
models and the phase diagram of congested trafﬁc states predicted by some second-order models and the
nonlocal, gas-kinetic based trafﬁc model (GKT model). For a correct understanding of empirical observations
such as the “general pattern,” it is important to consider particularities such as the fact that off-ramps can
act as bottlenecks, when activated by downstream on-ramp bottlenecks. As sequences of off- and on-ramps
generate different congestion patterns than single on-ramps, they must be treated as interconnected bottlenecks.
Furthermore, our empirical results question Kerner’s three-phase theory.

1. Introduction
In the past years, the ﬁeld of trafﬁc modeling has been
characterized by a controversy about the right under-
standing of one of its most fundamental subjects: traf-
ﬁc jams. One can distinguish at least three mutually
inconsistent standpoints:
1. The Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model (LWR

model) is sufﬁcient to understand the observed traf-
ﬁc phenomena (Daganzo 1995b, 2002b; Laval and
Daganzo 2004; Daganzo 1995a, 1994; Cassidy and
Mauch 2001; Lebacque 1995; Lebacque and Khosh-
yaran 2005).
2. So-called second-order models would be needed

to describe the observations (Nagel and Nelson 2005;
Helbing 2001b).
3. All previous approaches assuming a fundamen-

tal diagram, including the LWR and second-order
models, are wrong (Kerner 1999, 2004).
This controversy may be considered so fundamen-

tal that it questions trafﬁc ﬂow modeling as a scien-
tiﬁc discipline. Some confusion has been caused by
the evergrowing number of special terms invented
for certain observations, so that it is often unclear

whether certain terms are supposed to describe the
same observation or simulated trafﬁc state, or not.
Additional confusion has been caused by questioning
certain theories for the wrong reasons. We will discuss
these issues in §§2.2, 3.2, and 7.1. A third source of
confusion is the interpretation of empirical measure-
ment. This will be addressed in §5.1.
Our presentation is structured as follows: §§2 and

3 give a critical discussion of ﬁrst- and second-order
trafﬁc ﬂow models to point out their essential features
and identify the unresolved questions. While this part
has the features of a survey, it is needed to resolve
some misunderstandings in the literature and remind
us of relevant arguments that may have been forgot-
ten. Section 2.5 and the sections from 4.2 on will then
present our own new results, both theoretical and
empirical.
In the following, we give a more detailed overview:

§2 will shortly introduce the Lighthill-Whitham-
Richard (LWR) ﬁrst-order trafﬁc model and its prop-
erties. Based on this, we will discuss what criticisms
have been raised against it and how seriously they
must be taken. In particular, we will give empir-

ical evidence of growing perturbations pointing to
an instability of trafﬁc ﬂow (see §2.5). As these are
inconsistent with the LWR model, §3 will introduce
second-order trafﬁc models that imply unstable traf-
ﬁc ﬂows. However, second-order models have been
blamed for theoretical inconsistencies. Therefore, §3.2
will discuss whether and how these criticisms can be
overcome. This ﬁnally leads us to the nonlocal, gas-
kinetic-based trafﬁc model (GKT model) in §4, which
is theoretically consistent. It predicts different kinds
of congested trafﬁc states, which will be introduced
in §4.1. These states are predicted to occur under cer-
tain conditions concerning the freeway ﬂow and bot-
tleneck strengths, which can be illustrated by means
of a phase diagram (see §4.2). In contrast to previous
publications, we will distinguish situations of small
and large perturbations, which imply different phase
diagrams due to the predicted multistable nature of
trafﬁc ﬂows. This has great signiﬁcance for the com-
parison with empirical data of congested trafﬁc states,
which is the subject of §6. Before that, §5 motivates
the choice of our measurement site and describes its
features. It also introduces an adaptive smoothing
method, which is suited to visualize spatiotemporal
trafﬁc patterns in a three-dimensional way and to dis-
tinguish small but signiﬁcant perturbations from ran-
dom ﬂuctuations (see §5.3). This method helps to clas-
sify different trafﬁc states (see §6), to understand spa-
tial or temporal transitions between them (see §§6.7,
6.8), and to determine an empirical phase diagram
(see §6.6). Finally, §7 presents our summary and con-
clusions, including a discussion of Kerner’s criticism
of trafﬁc models (see §7.1) and his attempts to clas-
sify and explain empirical observations from the same
measurement site by the three-phase theory and its
extensions (see §7.2).

2. The Lighthill-Whitham-Richards
Model and Its Limits

2.1. Form and Properties of the
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards Model
(LWR Model)

One of the oldest and most-cited models of trafﬁc
ﬂow is the ﬂuid dynamic model by Lighthill and
Whitham (1995) and Richards (1956). It is based on
the continuity equation

���x� t�

�t
+ �Q�x� t�

�x
= 	+�x� t�− 	−�x� t�� (1)

where ��x� t� denotes the vehicle density and Q�x� t�
the trafﬁc ﬂow as a function of location x and time
t. This equation is a direct mathematical implication
of the conservation of the number of vehicles, i.e., the
fact that no vehicle is produced or lost along the free-
way (apart from cases of accidents, maybe). Therefore,

it is one of the most fundamental laws of trafﬁc ﬂows
and applies without any doubt (with the restriction
that trafﬁc ﬂows are not continuous, but composed of
discrete vehicles).
For the time being, we will set the source terms

	±�x� t� due to ramp ﬂows equal to zero (where the
plus sign corresponds to on-ramps and the minus
sign to off-ramps). Lighthill, Whitham, and Richard
have closed the above continuity equation assuming
a direct ﬂow-density relationship of the kind

Q�x� t�=Q���x� t��� (2)
which is called the “fundamental diagram.” This
requires an adiabatic (i.e. effectively instantaneous)
adaptation of the trafﬁc ﬂow and average vehicle
speed V = Q/� to the density �. Because the result-
ing “ﬂuid-dynamic” trafﬁc model does not contain
a second-order derivative (such as a diffusion term
D�2�/�x2), it is called a ﬁrst-order model.
One can rewrite the LWR model (1), (2) as a non-

linear wave equation

���x� t�

�t
+ dQ���

d�

���x� t�

�x
= 0� (3)

According to this, the density proﬁle propagates with
the speed c��� = dQ���/d�, i.e., a formal solution of
Equation (3) is given by

��x� t�= �
(
x−

∫ t
0
dt′c���yx�t

′�� t′���0
)
� (4)

where

yx�t

∫ t
t′
dt′′v�t′′�

with
dyx�t

′�
dt′

= v�t′�= c���yx�t′�� t′�� (5)

is the location with vehicle density � as a function of
time t′. As this deﬁnes an implicit equation for the
density ��x� t�, it is hard to solve explicitly (if c is not
a constant). However, we can see from Equation (4)
that the initial density proﬁle ��x�0� does not change
its amplitude in the course of time.1 The shape of the
density proﬁle can change if the propagation velocity
c��� is density dependent. For example, it is possible
that initially smooth density proﬁles will eventually
form shock fronts. These are predicted to propagate
with the velocity

C��+��−�=
Q��+�−Q��−�

�+ −�−
� (6)

1 According to Kerner, Klenov, and Konhäuser (1997), however, the
interaction of shock waves can lead to a reduction of the ampli-
tude. The opposite—i.e., an increase of the amplitude—has, to our
knowledge, not been reported.

where �+ denotes the density immediately upstream
of the shock front and �− the density immediately
downstream of it (Whitham 1974). Because this equa-
tion is a consequence of vehicle conservation, it is, by
the way, also expected to be approximately valid for
congestion fronts in second-order models.

2.2. Criticisms of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richard
Model

From a theoretical point of view, the LWR model
should be able to describe the propagation of
upstream and downstream shock fronts along homo-
geneous road sections and the formation of vehicle
queues upstream of bottlenecks. Empirical stud-
ies suggest that formula (6) is indeed suitable to
describe the propagation of upstream shock fronts of
spatially extended congestion patterns (Muñoz and
Daganzo 2003). Even Kerner uses this formula in his
patented trafﬁc state estimation tool ASDA/FOTO
(Kerner et al 2004; Kerner, Kirschﬁnk, and Rehborn
1998; Kerner and Rehborn 2000; Kerner, Aleksic,
and Denneler 2001; Kerner 2001), although he has
strongly criticized the LWR model for not describ-
ing two subsequent wide moving jams well (Kerner,
Klenov, and Konhäuser 1997). Kerner and Konhäuser
(1994a), stated that, according to the LWR model,
when assuming a parabolic fundamental diagram, the
downstream shock fronts would eventually change
their shape and become smoother and smoother. In
contrast, the experimental data support a stable veloc-
ity proﬁle over time, moving upstream with constant
velocity (Kerner and Rehborn 1996a).
Although Lin and Lo (2003) have pointed out that

two wide moving clusters propagating at the same
speed can be simulated with the LWR model, if the
fundamental diagram Q��� is linear in the congested
(high-density) region, Kerner’s criticism has not been
convincingly addressed. Lin and Lo have not shown
that, without being sensitive to the assumed form of
the fundamental diagram and to initial and bound-
ary conditions, wide moving jams have invariant,
continuous wave proﬁles and characteristic constants
as results of self-organization. According to Kerner
(1998b), these characteristic constants include the res-
olution speed c= c0 of downstream congestion fronts
(while formula (6) allows for different speeds C),
the density �jam inside of jams, and the outﬂow Qout
from jams. Kerner and Rehborn (1996a) have given
some empirical support of these features. It is claimed
that the propagation speed of wide jams would not
even be inﬂuenced by passing congested ﬂow (Kerner
1998b), ramps, or intersections (Kerner and Rehborn
1996a; Kerner 2000a, b).
Recently, Nagel and Nelson (2005) summarized the

criticisms of the LWR model, stating that
1. it would not be able to describe unstable ﬂow,

2. it would not describe spontaneous breakdowns
of trafﬁc ﬂow, and
3. it would not explain the two-capacity phe-

nomenon (“capacity drop”).
While Kerner and Rehborn (1996b, 1998) ﬁnd quite

remarkable capacity drops by about one-third of
the maximum measured ﬂow values (one-minute
aggregates), other authors question the measurement
method (Daganzo, Cassidy, and Bertini 1999; Persaud
and Hurdle 1991; Banks 1991a, b) or ﬁnd consider-
ably smaller capacity drops in data of U.S. freeways
(Persaud, Yagar, and Brownlee 1998; Westland 1998;
Cassidy and Bertini 1999; Banks 1991b). Therefore,
the capacity drop seems not to be a ﬁnally accepted
fact, although the concept is very old (Edie and Foote
1960). From our point of view, the capacity drop is not
the most important issue. It depends on what reduc-
tion in the time gaps drivers ﬁnd acceptable under
free (i.e., easily predictable) trafﬁc conditions com-
pared with the reaction time to unexpected events
(Treiber, Kesting, and Helbing 2006).
Concerning spontaneous breakdowns, some eval-

uations of vehicle trajectories based on aerial pho-
tographs suggest the existence of phantom trafﬁc jams
(Treiterer and Myers 1974; Treiterer and Taylor 1966),
i.e., the spontaneous formation of trafﬁc jams with no
obvious reason, such as an accident or a bottleneck.
This interpretation has been questioned by Daganzo
(2002a), who states that the breakdown of free traf-
ﬁc “can be traced back to a lane change in front of
a highly compressed set of cars” and suggests that
there actually is a reason for jam formation. However,
its origin can be a rather small disturbance. Muñoz
and Daganzo (2002a, p. 134) also proposes that the
“spontaneous” formation of a trafﬁc jam reported by
Kerner and Rehborn (1997) may actually have been
caused by disturbances by vehicles trying to leave the
freeway over a nearby off-ramp.
The existence of unstable ﬂow is a controver-

sial issue as well (see next paragraph). However, it
seems to be commonly accepted that the LWR model,
without particular assumptions or extensions, cannot
describe growing amplitudes in the density, speed, or
ﬂow proﬁles, the spontaneous emergence of stop-and-go
waves, or other kinds of oscillating trafﬁc patterns.

2.3. Stop-and-Go Waves (Also: Start-Stop Waves)
Stop-and-go waves have been empirically studied by
many authors, including Edie and Baverez (1965),
Mika, Kreer, and Yuan (1969), and Koshi, Iwasaki, and
Ohkura (1983). The latter have found that the parts of
the velocity proﬁle that belong to the ﬂuent stages of
stop-and-go waves do not signiﬁcantly depend on the
ﬂow (regarding their height and length), while their
oscillation frequency does. Correspondingly, there is
no characteristic frequency of stop-and-go trafﬁc. The

average duration of one wave period is normally
between 4 and 20 minutes for wide trafﬁc jams; see,
e.g., Mika, Kreer, and Yuan (1969), Kühne (1987),
Helbing (1997d), Helbing (1997a), Helbing (1997c);
and the average wave length between 2.5 and 5 km,
see, e.g., Kerner (1998a). Stop-and-go waves propa-
gate against the direction of the vehicle ﬂow (Edie
and Baverez 1965; Mika, Kreer, and Yuan 1969) with
a velocity c = c0 �= −15 ± 5 km/h (see, e.g., Mika,
Kreer, and Yuan 1969; Kerner and Rehborn 1996a;
Kerner 2000a, b; Cassidy and Mauch 2001), and with-
out spreading (Cassidy and Windover 1995; Windover
1998; Muñoz and Daganzo 1999).

2.4. Possible Origins of Oscillations
The existence of stop-and-go waves seems to be an
accepted fact in the meantime. For example, Daganzo
(2002a) notes in one of his studies that “large oscilla-
tions in ﬂow, speed and cumulative count increase in
amplitude across the detectors spanning a long free-
way queue and its intervening on-ramps” (p. 133).
Moreover, Cassidy and Bertini (1999) state that ”the
discharge ﬂows in active bottlenecks exhibit near-
stationary patterns that (slowly) alternate about a con-
stant rate [� � �] The onset of upstream queueing was
always accompanied by an especially low discharge
ﬂow followed by a recovery rate and these are the
effects of driver behavior we do not yet understand”
(p. 40).
Even today, there is still no agreement about the

mechanism generating stop-and-go waves. Laval and
Daganzo (2006) suggests explaining emergent oscil-
lations by lane-changing maneuvers, particularly at
locations close to on-ramps or off-ramps. In fact, it
has recently been shown that coordination problems
at bottleneck areas can trigger intermittent outﬂows,
which can be explained with a slightly modiﬁed conti-
nuity equation, i.e., a ﬁrst-order model (Helbing et al.
2006). However, how should small oscillations grow
larger until they ﬁnally form wide-moving jams or
stop-and-go waves? Daganzo (2002b) and Mauch and
Cassidy (2002) suggest that small oscillations may be
increased in amplitude due to a “pumping effect” at
ramps, i.e., a positive feedback mechanism.

2.5. Growing Perturbations and the
Boomerang Effect

The open question is: Do oscillations grow only when
ramps or changes in the number of lanes can support
a pumping effect? If not, this would seriously ques-
tion the LWR model, while it would support mod-
els predicting unstable trafﬁc ﬂows. While the experi-
ments by Sugiyama et al. (2005) studying circular traf-
ﬁc ﬂows at high vehicle densities support the idea
of unstable trafﬁc ﬂow, it must be considered that
drivers may have unintentionally been inﬂuenced by
the experimental setup.

Therefore, let us discuss some of our empirical
results to motivate the following sections of our
paper. A Fourier analysis (not shown here) has been
carried out to make sure that the oscillations on the
investigated German freeway A5 were not induced by
pulsating inﬂows, because they could be produced by
trafﬁc lights on the way to the on-ramp. Nevertheless,
we found several examples of the growth of down-
stream moving, small perturbations along a three-lane
freeway section without on- and off-ramps; and of the
growth of upstream moving, large perturbations (see
Figures 1 and 2). These examples show that neither
the proposed pumping effect nor the LWR equation
are satisfactory explanations.
We call the mechanism of generating large mov-

ing clusters shown in Figures 1 and 2 the boomerang
effect (Helbing 2001a; Helbing et al. 2003). The
boomerang effect clearly supports trafﬁc models with
an unstable density range. It can be seen in traf-
ﬁc simulations with second-order models Kerner and
Konhäuser (1993) and explained as follows: On the
one hand, a small perturbation corresponds to a clus-
ter of vehicles, which moves forward in downstream
direction together with the vehicles. On the other
hand, a large perturbation like a moving localized
trafﬁc jam propagates upstream. While inside of the
trafﬁc jam vehicles are standing, vehicles are leaving it
at its downstream front, and new vehicles are joining
the jam at its upstream front. Altogether, this implies
an upstream motion of the jam. When a small pertur-
bation grows in size due to unstable trafﬁc ﬂow, the
propagation direction is eventually turning around,
which is reﬂected by the term “boomerang effect.”
Although a breakdown of trafﬁc ﬂow is not always

related to the boomerang effect, it occurs rather fre-
quently (see also Figures 9b, 13b, 20b, and 21a). At
least 18 out of 245 congestion patterns were triggered
in this way. However, the effect is hard to recog-
nize without a suitable method of data preprocessing
such as the adaptive smoothing method (see §5.3).
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that our observation of
the boomerang effect is an artifact of our method of
data representation: It can also sometimes be seen in
classical contour plots without particular preprocess-
ing (Helbing et al. 2003). The same applies to some
three-dimensional plots without any spatial smooth-
ing, when the data are suitably smoothed in time (see
Figure 1), or to the raw time series (see Figure 2).

3. Second-Order Models and Their
Criticism

Notes. According to the LWR model, the amplitude of the spatiotemporal velocity proﬁle should not grow along a freeway section without ramps. However, in
(a), we see a small perturbation propagating downstream and growing slowly. After reaching a sufﬁciently large size and crossing a bottleneck, trafﬁc breaks
down, the perturbation changes its direction (“boomerang effect”) and travels upstreams with a signiﬁcant growth in amplitude. In order to exclude that the
growth could be an interpolation effect due to the application of the adaptive smoothing method (see §5.3), (b) shows the same data set, but without any
spatial smoothing. In contrast to (a), the time-dependent velocity data at the different measurement cross-sections are shown from behind. (c), (d) Examples

tion (2), which implies an immediate adaptation of
the vehicle velocity V ���x� t�� = Q���x� t��/��x� t� to

els assume the general ﬂuid-dynamic relationship
Q�x� t�= ��x� t�V �x� t� with an additional partial dif-
ferential equation for the spatiotemporal change of
the average velocity V �x� t� of vehicles. This can often

This equation was inspired by the Navier-Stokes equa-

we may call this equation the Payne-Whitham-

1979; Whitham 1974; Kühne 1984; Kerner and

Konhäuser 1993; Lee, Lee, and Kim 1999). These equa-
tions predict linear instability under the condition

Notice that the Lighthill-Whitham model results in

els by Payne (1971) and Papageorgiou (1983) are

Notes. According to the LWR model, the amplitude of the spatiotemporal velocity proﬁle should not grow along a freeway section without ramps. However,
in both data sets, we see a small perturbation, which eventually increases: First, while propagating downstream, the extension of the localized perturbation
grows, i.e., the time intervals, in which ﬂows are high and velocities are reduced (cf. the arrows and circles). This is because more and more vehicles join the
slower vehicle cluster from behind, which may be caused by a moving bottleneck due to overtaking trucks, as suggested by the peaks in the truck fraction
at the beginning of the vehicle cluster (right). From one cross-section to the next downstream one, trafﬁc needs more time to reach a “normal” state again.
Finally, approximately one kilometer before the off-ramp at “Intersection Frankfurt North-West,” which induces many lane-changing maneuvers because of the
high off-ramp ﬂow (left: 1,980 veh/h/lane between 7:05 a.m. and 7:15 a.m.; right: 1,767 veh/h/lane between 7:05 a.m. and 7:15 a.m.), the velocity drops to
values around 60 km/h, and a trafﬁc jam travelling against the driving direction appears. Afterward, the reduction in the average speed and ﬂow increases with
time, thereby causing a growth in the amplitude of the perturbation. To calculate the velocities of the stop waves, we determined the location-speciﬁc time
when the velocity exceeded the value 60 km/h after the stop wave had passed. Applying linear regression, these times, together with the detector locations,
implied the mean velocity of the stop wave. On 09/25/01 (left) it was −16�8± 1�4 km/h, whereas on 04/04/01 (right) it was −18�0± 0�8 km/h. The velocities
of the downstream propagating perturbations were �66±6� km/h (left) and �76±6� km/h (right). To obtain these velocities, we used the times when the mean
velocity at the cross-sections fell below 110 km/h.

1987) and Kerner and Konhäuser (1993) result for P =
��0, where �0 is a positive constant. In comparison
with a similar model by Whitham (1974), they assume
a ﬁnite viscosity to smooth out shock fronts. This is
desirable from an empirical and numerical point of
view, but implies theoretical inconsistencies (see the
next paragraph).

3.2. How to Survive the Requiem for
Second-Order Trafﬁc Models

Second-order models have been seriously criticized
by Daganzo (1995b):
1. The second-order models would not be well

derived from microscopic models, and there were
problems with terminating series expansions.



Schönhof and Helbing: Empirical Features of Congested Trafﬁc States
Transportation Science 41(2), pp. 135–166, © 2007 INFORMS 141

2. The gas-kinetic derivations would imply that the
speed was a property of the street rather than the
drivers, and different personalities of drivers, e.g.,
aggressive and timid ones, could not be distinguished.
3. The applied numerical solution schemes were

often improper, with many “engineering ﬁxes” and
too many parameters to ﬁt to empirical data. As a
consequence, these models would have low predic-
tive power.
4. There were inconsistencies regarding the vehicle

velocities. For example, in the case of a discontinuous
density change at the end of a trafﬁc jam, vehicles
should be moving backwards due to the symmetric
viscosity term.
5. It would be a problem that one of the character-

istic speeds of the second-order model (describing the
propagation of perturbations) was faster than V , the
speed of vehicles.
At the time of publication of the “requiem,” most

of these criticisms were justiﬁed. The many differ-
ent speciﬁcations of the pressure and relaxation term
in the literature indicate that there was consider-
able confusion about the meaning and derivation of
these terms. In physics, the velocity equation can
be derived from a gas-kinetic description. Such an
approach has been followed in trafﬁc modeling as
well, starting with Prigogine (1961), Paveri-Fontana
(1975), and Phillips (1977). Based on today’s knowl-
edge, the conclusions from successful efforts to link
microscopic and macroscopic trafﬁc models (Helbing
et al. 2002) are as follows:
1. The viscosity term cannot be justiﬁed for one-

dimensional ﬂows as it is in physics. It either drops
out completely or results from a gradient expansion,
but then it looks differently. The pressure has the form
P = ��, where � represents the velocity variance of
vehicles. Of course, the variance must vanish when-
ever vehicles are stopped, i.e., � = 0 if V = 0. The
effect of the pressure term can be imagined as fol-
lows: Starting with a cluster of vehicles on a multilane
freeway, the cluster will eventually widen due to the
faster vehicles leaving the slower ones behind. Note
that problems of series expansion can be avoided by
direct derivation of macroscopic models from micro-
scopic ones (Helbing et al. 2002, pp. 543 ff.).
2. Gas-kinetic models can be used to derive mul-

ticlass multilane models (Helbing 1997d, b; Klar and
Wegener 1999a, b; Hoogendoorn and Bovy 1998)
in order to model passing interactions and differ-
ent behaviors of driver-vehicle units. These allow us
to distinguish different personalities of drivers (e.g.,
aggressive and timid ones) as demanded. These mul-
ticlass models also fulﬁll the requirement that the
vehicle velocities should not be a property of the road,
but of the drivers. The same already applies to some
earlier models (Paveri-Fontana 1975; Helbing 1996;
Helbing and Greiner 1997; Wagner et al. 1996).

3. Today, proper numerical integration schemes are
known (Kronjäger and Konhäuser 1997; Helbing and
Treiber 1999), and high values of anticipation coefﬁ-
cients can be avoided by nonlocal interaction terms
(Helbing and Treiber 1999).
4. The phenomenological viscosity term must be

dropped, but the nonlocal interaction terms result
in reasonable, anisotropic smoothing effects (Helbing
and Treiber 1999).
5. The faster characteristic speed is actually not a

problem if � is correctly interpreted as velocity vari-
ance. Then, the two characteristic speeds are c+/− ≈
V ±√�, i.e., the faster characteristic speed is just one
standard deviation faster than the average velocity.
Clearly, information can be propagated by the faster
vehicles at this speed if we assume a ﬁnite veloc-
ity variance. Otherwise, if � = 0, the pressure term
disappears, implying c+ = c− = V . Moreover, pertur-
bations moving with the faster speed c+ decay very
quickly (Whitham 1974, pp. 339 ff.; Yi et al. 2003).
Therefore, they are not expected to occur in normal
trafﬁc situations.

4. The Nonlocal, Gas-Kinetic-Based
Trafﬁc Model (GKT Model)

To overcome Daganzo’s criticisms, it is necessary to
derive a macroscopic trafﬁc model from an empir-
ically supported microscopic trafﬁc model (not vice
versa). The main problem to be avoided is the pos-
sible occurrence of negative speeds, not the existence
of a characteristic speed c+ faster than the average
velocity V (as long as it does not exceed the speed
of the fastest car). However, negative speeds can be
easily prevented by interpreting � as the velocity vari-
ance of cars, which must vanish when vehicles are
stopped. This constraint can, for example, be ful-
ﬁlled by setting ����V �= ����V 2, with an empirically
determined function ���� > 0 (Helbing 1997d, 1998;
Treiber, Hennecke, and Helbing 1999).
One critical question, however, remains: As the

pressure term −�1/�������/�� can become positive,
would that mean that cars would potentially accel-
erate into high-density areas? This is not the case, if
the relaxation term �Ve − V �/� compensates for neg-
ative �����/��, as in the nonlocal, gas-kinetic-based
trafﬁc (GKT) model (Helbing 1997d, 1998). The non-
locality of this model reﬂects the interaction with
upstream vehicles in a certain distance and causes
a forward smoothing with no reaction to backward
conditions, in contrast to a viscosity term (Helbing
and Treiber 1999; Helbing et al. 2002).2 In summary,

2 This also implies a higher numerical efﬁciency despite its more
complicated mathematical form. Naturally, the nonlocal GKT
model takes into account effects of space requirements by vehicle

Figure 3 Simulation of Trafﬁc on a Freeway with an On-Ramp at Location x = 10 km, Assuming an Initial Disturbance Travelling Upstream and
Using the Nonlocal, Gas-Kinetic-Based Trafﬁc (GKT) Model

Notes. Depending on the respective trafﬁc ﬂows on the ramp and on the freeway, ﬁve different kinds of congested trafﬁc states emerge: a moving localized
cluster (MLC), a pinned localized cluster (PLC), stop-and-go waves (SGW), oscillating congested trafﬁc (OCT), or homogeneous congested trafﬁc (HCT).
During the ﬁrst minutes of the simulation, the ﬂows on the freeway and the on-ramp were increased from low values to their ﬁnal values.

the GKT model is theoretically consistent and numeri-
cally efﬁcient (Helbing and Treiber 1999). But is it also
realistic? In order to compare it with empirical facts
(see §6), we will now discuss its implications regard-
ing the predicted congestion states and their respec-
tive preconditions.

4.1. Congested Trafﬁc States
For our classiﬁcation of the trafﬁc states predicted by
the nonlocal GKT model, it is not necessary to present
its mathematical form here (for details, see Treiber,
Hennecke, and Helbing 1999; Helbing 2001b; Helbing
et al. 2001, 2002). In this model, congested trafﬁc is
typically triggered by bottlenecks (i.e., spatial inho-
mogeneities along the freeway). As an example, we
will discuss the situation of an on-ramp entering an
n-lane freeway at location x= 5 kilometer. If the ramp
ﬂows Qrmp are equally distributed over a ramp length
L, we have an inﬂow of

	+ =
Qrmp

nL
� (9)

which must be inserted into Equation (1). This inﬂow
consumes some of the capacity of the freeway and
causes a bottleneck strength, the size of which is given
by the entering ramp ﬂow, divided by the number of
freeway lanes:

 Q= Qrmp

lengths and safe time clearances. Correlations between the veloci-
ties of successive cars can be easily treated as well (Shvetsov and
Helbing 1999).

When systematically varying the ramp ﬂow Qrmp and
the freeway ﬂow Qup upstream of the bottleneck, we
ﬁnd free ﬂow or different kinds of congested ﬂow
(Helbing, Hennecke, and Treiber 1999). Typical repre-
sentatives are shown in Figure 3.
In contrast to Kerner’s classiﬁcation, we do not dis-

tinguish the different trafﬁc states based on measure-
ments at discrete cross-sections of the freeway. Instead,
we study the average vehicle speed Vt�x� along a free-
way section as a function of time or the speeds v�x�t��
along trajectories of representative vehicles given by
the relationship dx�t�/dt = v�x�t��. These quantities
are determined based on the three-dimensional rep-
resentation of the average velocity V �x� t� as a func-
tion of location x and time t, which is obtained from
cross-sectional measurements by means of an adap-
tive smoothing method (see §5.3).
If Vt�x� or v�x�t�� are above a certain threshold Vtr,

where x is varied within a homogeneous freeway sec-
tion upstream of a bottleneck (an inhomogeneity), we
call the trafﬁc state free trafﬁc (FT)—otherwise, we
have congested trafﬁc. If these speeds fall below Vtr
only over a short freeway subsection, and the length
of this section is approximately stable or stabilizes
over time, we talk about localized clusters (LC), other-
wise, of spatially extended congestion states. According
to simulations, there are two forms of localized clus-
ters: Pinned localized clusters (PLC) stay at a ﬁxed loca-
tion over a longer period of time, while moving local-
ized clusters (MLC), corresponding to Kerner’s wide-
moving jams (Kerner and Rehborn 1996a), propagate
upstream with the characteristic speed c0. Stop-and-
go waves (SGW) may be interpreted as a sequence of



Schönhof and Helbing: Empirical Features of Congested Trafﬁc States

several moving localized clusters. Alternatively, they
may be viewed as special case of oscillating congested
trafﬁc (OCT), but with free trafﬁc ﬂow of order Qout
between the upstream propagating jams. Generally,
however, OCT states are just characterized by oscil-
lating speeds in the congested range. If the speeds
are congested over a spatially extended area, but not
oscillating, we call this homogeneous congested trafﬁc
(HCT). This is typically related to low velocities.
In summary, besides free trafﬁc, the GKT model

predicts ﬁve different spatiotemporal patterns of con-
gested trafﬁc states at a simple on-ramp bottleneck:
PLC, MLC, SGW, OCT, and HCT. Similar trafﬁc
states have been identiﬁed for second-order mod-
els such as the Kerner-Konhäuser model (Lee, Lee,
and Kim 1999) and for ﬂow-conserving bottlenecks in
a car-following model (Treiber, Hennecke, and Hel-
bing 2000; Helbing et al. 2002). Note that in empirical
data, the SGW state may be hard to distinguish from
OCT states due to their similar appearance. Moreover,
models assuming adaptive driver behavior or hetero-
geneous trafﬁc (i.e., different driver-vehicle classes)
may predict variants of the states depicted in Figure 3.
However, the trafﬁc patterns are expected to be simi-
lar for all models with the same stability diagram (see
next section). Finally, in cases of several bottlenecks
along the freeway, it should be possible that several
different congestion patterns are combined with each
other, giving rise to a large number of possible con-
gestion patterns with a complex appearance (see §§6.7
and 6.9).

4.2. Phase Diagram of Trafﬁc States
The preconditions for the possible occurrence of the
different trafﬁc states can be illustrated by a phase
diagram (see Figure 4). Each area of the phase
diagram represents the parameter combinations for
which certain kinds of trafﬁc states can exist. The bor-
derlines between different areas (the so-called phase
boundaries) can be theoretically understood, based
on the instability diagram and the dynamic capac-
ity Qout, i.e., the characteristic outﬂow from congested
trafﬁc (Kerner and Rehborn 1996a). As a consequence,
second-order models with a similar instability dia-
gram are expected to imply similar trafﬁc states and
phase diagrams as does the GKT model (see, e.g., Lee,
Lee, and Kim 1999).
For the theoretical derivation of the phase bound-

aries, one must know that the nonlocal GKT model
(like the Kerner-Konhäuser model from 1993) predicts
stable trafﬁc ﬂow, when the velocity changes little
with the density. More speciﬁcally, there is stable traf-
ﬁc below some critical density �c1 and above some
critical density �c4 (see Figure 5).
For medium trafﬁc densities between two critical

densities �c2 and �c3, trafﬁc ﬂow is linearly unstable,

States Assuming (a) Negligible and (b) Large Perturbations

Notes. The different areas indicate for which combinations of the upstream
freeway ﬂow Qup and the bottleneck strength �Q certain trafﬁc states (see
Figure 3) are predicted to exist. Superimposing both diagrams shows that
many areas are multistable (see Figure 15a). That is, depending on the initial
and boundary conditions, one may ﬁnd one out of several possible states.
Note that the value of Qmax depends on the speed limit V0. SGW states are a
special case of OCT states, in which the trafﬁc between the congested areas
ﬂows freely. The existence of PLC and MLC states for a certain range of ﬂows
indicates that their actual outﬂow can assume a range of different values
between Qc1 and Qc2.

i.e., even small perturbations can grow and cause a
breakdown of trafﬁc ﬂow. In the intermediate den-
sity ranges �c1 ≤ � < �c2 and �c3 < � ≤ �c4, one ﬁnds
metastable trafﬁc, i.e., sufﬁciently small perturbations
will fade away, while large enough ones will grow
and cause a breakdown of trafﬁc ﬂow. The value of
Qout falls into the metastable regime between �c1 and
�c2. It depends on the maximum density and the aver-

age time gap, i.e., on the weather conditions, the truck
fraction, and lane.3

With this background information, we can now
formulate conditions for the existence of the differ-
ent trafﬁc states. Doing so, it is important not to
restrict ourselves to the situations with large ini-
tial perturbations, which have been studied before
(Helbing, Hennecke, and Treiber 1999). This will high-
light the multistable nature of trafﬁc ﬂows. That is,
even for the same average ramp and freeway ﬂows,
different trafﬁc states can ultimately result if the ini-
tial and boundary conditions—e.g., the perturbation
sizes—differ. This will be important for the compar-
ison with empirical data in §6. Figure 4 displays the
phase diagram resulting for small perturbations sepa-
rately from the one for large perturbations in order to
resolve a misunderstanding by Kerner, according to
which the GKT model would predict a transition from
free ﬂow to “synchronized” congested ﬂows only after
the occurrence of moving jams (Kerner 2005). For

3 According to Kerner and Rehborn (1996a), the typical outﬂow Qout
from congested trafﬁc on the German autobahn A5 near Frankfurt
is 1,100 veh/h for the right lane, 1,600 veh/h for the middle lane,
and 1,800 veh/h for the left lane if the vehicles inside the conges-
tion (nearly) get to a standstill.

small perturbations, this is actually not the case (see
Figure 4a).
Remembering that the bottleneck strength  Q =

Qrmp/�nL� relates to the effective ramp ﬂow and Qup
denotes the upstream trafﬁc ﬂow on the freeway, the
total freeway capacity required downstream of the
ramp amounts to

Qtot =Qup+ Q� (11)

Therefore, we always expect to ﬁnd spatially extended,
growing congestion states, if the maximum freeway
ﬂow Qmax =max� Q��� is exceeded, i.e.,

Qtot =Qup+ Q>Qmax� (12)

which corresponds to the region above line A in Fig-
ure 4.4 Free trafﬁc ﬂow can in principle exist under
the condition Qup+ Q<Qmax, the region below line
A in Figure 4a. This region can be further subdi-
vided: While above the threshold Q��c1� of metastable
trafﬁc—i.e., for

Qtot =Qup+ Q>Q��c1�� (13)

corresponding to the region above line C in Figure 4,
large enough perturbations can also trigger congested
trafﬁc states, no congested state can occur for

Qtot =Qup+ Q<Q��c1�� (14)

Under this condition, i.e., below line C, one should
always ﬁnd free ﬂow.
Assuming model parameters for which the max-

imum ﬂow Qmax is realized for a density approxi-
mately equal to �c2, trafﬁc ﬂows between the two
diagonal lines A and C, i.e., Qup +  Q = Q��c1� and
Qup + Q =Qmax in the  Q-over-Qup phase diagram
can be either congested or free, depending on the ini-
tial and boundary conditions.5 Particularly, while free
ﬂow may persist over long time periods, large pertur-
bations may trigger congested trafﬁc states.
Spatially extended congestion can only emerge for

Qup >Qout− Q� (15)

i.e., if the required capacity Qtot =Qup+ Q is greater
than the available dynamic capacity in the case of
congested trafﬁc, which is given the outﬂow from
congested trafﬁc Qout. This line B in Figure 4, in
principle, does not have to be parallel to lines A
and C, because Qout may depend on the bottleneck

4 Note that Qmax is a function of the speed limit V0.
5 If Qmax signiﬁcantly differs from Qc2, the situation becomes more
complicated.

strength  Q (Treiber, Hennecke, and Helbing 2000;
Helbing 2001b). For

Q��c1�≤Qtot =Qup+ Q<Qout� (16)
i.e., in the region below line B, congested trafﬁc states
cannot grow because the freeway capacity for con-
gested trafﬁc is higher than the totally required capac-
ity Qtot. This implies that any resulting congestion
state should be a localized cluster, i.e., constraint to a
short freeway section. The existence of moving localized
clusters (MLC) requires that the trafﬁc ﬂow in the free-
way section upstream of the ramp is metastable, i.e.,

Qup ≥Q��c1�� (17)
Otherwise, if Qup <Q��c1�, no MLC can survive, and
only free ﬂow can exist in the upstream area. Rather
than propagating through this area, the localized con-
gestion must stay at the location of the ramp, which
results in a pinned localized cluster (PLC).6

Let us now discuss the different possible forms of
spatially extended congested trafﬁc: The trafﬁc ﬂow
Qcong resulting in the congested area is given by the
outﬂow Qout from congested trafﬁc minus the inﬂow
(or bottleneck strength)  Q, i.e.,

Qcong =Qout− Q� (18)
One can distinguish the following cases: Homogeneous
congested trafﬁc (HCT) will always occur if the den-
sity �cong associated with the congested ﬂow Qcong =
Q��cong� lies in the stable range:

Qcong ≤Q��c4�� i.e.�  Q≥Qout−Q��c4�� (19)
Moreover, it can occur in the metastable range

Qcong ≤Q��c3�� i.e.�  Q≥Qout−Q��c3�� (20)
if perturbations in the trafﬁc ﬂow are small enough.
If the perturbations are supercritical, however,

extended oscillating congested trafﬁc (OCT) can emerge
whenever

 Q≤Qout−Q��c4� and Qup >Qout− Q (21)
(see Figure 4b). In the linearly unstable range

 Q≤Qout−Q��c3� and Qup >Qout− Q� (22)

6 Note that pinned localized clusters could also exist under
metastable conditions, i.e., for Qup < Q��c2� and Qtot < Qmax, if
the speed inside the PLC state was ﬁnite and the outﬂow higher
than Qout ≈ 1�800 vehicles per kilometer and lane. For the outﬂow
QPLCout �V � of a PLC state as a function of the average vehicle speed
V , we conjecture that limV→0QPLCout �V �=Qout and limV→V0 QPLCout �V �=
Qmax (cf. Figure 17). An analogous speed-dependence of the outﬂow
Qout would apply to other congested trafﬁc states if the vehicles
would still move forward with a ﬁnite average speed V inside the
congested area.

extended congested trafﬁc will always produce oscil-
lating rather than homogeneous congested ﬂow. Stop-
and-go waves (SGW) are a special case of OCT. They
should primarily occur for not-too-large average den-
sities �cong in the (partially) congested area—i.e., small
enough bottleneck strengths  Q, because they require
free trafﬁc ﬂow between the congested areas.

5. Measurement of Congested
Trafﬁc States

5.1. Choice of the Measurement Site
In the following, we will study data from the German
autobahn A5 close to Frankfurt/Main, because this
measurement site includes several large road sections
without on- and off-ramps, and regularly suffers from
severe trafﬁc congestion. Because this measurement
site has been the basis of most of Kerner’s empiri-
cal investigations, it also allows us to gain an inde-
pendent judgement of the trafﬁc dynamics on this
freeway, and to assess the validity of Kerner’s far-
reaching conclusions. Such an independent study is
needed, because Kerner has called all trafﬁc models
containing a fundamental diagram into question. We
will show that this has been done partly for the wrong
reasons (see §7.1).
Some of the issues that Kerner has not addressed

in a satisfactory way are the following: What are the
implications of freeway properties such as
1. signiﬁcant gradients along the freeway,
2. the high truck fraction, which varies strongly,
3. the frequent occurrence of accidents or break-

downs of cars,
4. the operation of an “intelligent speed control

system” (which adaptively limits the speeds in cases
of an expected trafﬁc breakdown to 120 km/h or
100 km/h and in cases of an actual breakdown grad-
ually to 80 km/h or even 60 km/h), and
5. the existence of very long ramps (as they provide

an additional lane)?
We will see that neglecting such aspects leads to

special rather than general conclusions, and some-
times even to wrong ones:
1. For example, we will ﬁnd a new mechanism gen-

erating stop-and-go waves at gradient-related bottle-
necks (see §6.4).
2. Another mechanism producing stop-and-go

waves is based on the boomerang effect, which is
probably caused by overtaking maneuvers of trucks
(see Figures 2, 20b, and 21a).
3. Breakdowns of cars and accidents often cause

complex congestion patterns at unexpected locations,
including homogeneous congested trafﬁc (see §§6.2
and 6.3).
4. The intelligent speed control system is proba-

bly responsible for the homogeneous-in-speed type

of “synchronized” congested ﬂow (Kerner 1998b);
see §7.2.
5. Long off-ramps allow one to leave the freeway

when congested trafﬁc becomes visible downstream.
This adaptive response of drivers to downstream
congestion is probably related to the “pinch effect”
(Kerner 1998a), see §6.7. Long on-ramps may cause
downstream ﬂows that are higher than the outﬂow
Qout from congested trafﬁc, because a certain propor-
tion ��t� of the on-ramp ﬂow may be able to enter
the freeway downstream of the congestion front that
is caused by the remaining proportion 1−��t� of the
on-ramp ﬂow.7

Moreover, the following questions must be
addressed: What implications does it have if empir-
ical data are compared with results of macroscopic
simulation data without considering the measure-
ment (data aggregation) method? Would empirical
ﬁndings such as the scattering of synchronized ﬂows
be naturally reproduced by a macroscopic trafﬁc ﬂow
model if multiclass and multilane effects are taken
into account? We will come back to this in §7.1.

5.2. Description of the Measurement Site and
Trafﬁc Data

In the following investigation, we will focus on veloc-
ity data aggregated over one-minute intervals for a
freeway section frequently suffering from serious con-
gestion. Measurements were available for all free-
way lanes and most ramps. However, apart from the
investigation of exceptional situations such as acci-
dents, we have arithmetically averaged the speeds
over all freeway lanes (which is particularly justi-
ﬁed for synchronized ﬂows or other congested traf-
ﬁc states). A sketch of the measurement site is pre-
sented in Figure 6. It shows an approximately 30-
kilometer-long freeway section, which for the most
part has three lanes into each direction, three inter-
sections with other freeways, and one junction. At the
intersections, there are additional merging and
diverging lanes, some of which are more than one
kilometer long. Between the intersections “Frank-
furt North-West” and “Bad Homburg,” but also
between the latter section and the junction “Fried-
berg,” there are two approximately 10-kilometer-long
three-lane freeway sections without disturbances by
on- or off-ramps. However, the freeway crosses a
valley between kilometers 478 and 480 with gradi-
ents of about 2%–3%, which causes an additional
ﬂow-conserving bottleneck in the northern direction.

7 The description of a scenario with such a particular on-ramp
design is as follows: If ��t�Qrmp�t� with 0 ≤ ��t� ≤ 1 is the frac-
tion of the ramp ﬂow Qrmp�t� entering the freeway downstream of
the congestion front, the effective bottleneck strength is  Q�t� =
�1− ��t��Qrmp�t�/n, and the ﬂow downstream of the bottleneck is
Qdown�t�=Qout +��t�Qrmp�t�/n.

Moreover, there is a relatively steep hill (“Köpperner
Berg”) between kilometers 471 and 472.5, with gra-
dients up to 5%, but its effect on trafﬁc ﬂow in the
southern direction is small compared to the slightly
upstream located Junction Friedberg (although the
average vehicle speed at Köpperner Berg is often as
small as 60 km/h, possibly also due to the opera-
tion of the intelligent speed control). The main bot-
tlenecks of the studied freeway section in the south-
ern direction are the Junction Friedberg at kilometer
471 and the Intersection Bad Homburg at kilometer
481 (see top of Figure 6), while the main bottlenecks
in the northern direction are the Intersection Frank-
furt North-West at kilometer 489 and the bottleneck at
kilometer 478 due to the uphill gradient (see middle
of Figure 6).
We have investigated the available data for both

driving directions of the above freeway between
04/01/2001 and 09/30/2001 (165 days), which allows
us to identify the typical features of trafﬁc ﬂow and
to make statistical analyses. On these days (distin-
guishing both directions), we identiﬁed more than
240 breakdowns of trafﬁc ﬂow at several bottlenecks,
mostly during the morning rush hour between about
7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and during the afternoon rush
hour between about 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. (on Fridays,
between about 1 p.m. and 7 p.m.). Breakdowns were
also induced by holiday trafﬁc or accidents. The latter
normally occurred outside of the typical bottleneck
areas and were protocolled by the road authorities.
During the investigated time period, about 500 acci-
dents or breakdowns of vehicles have occurred. How-
ever, most of them had only a minor impact on the
trafﬁc ﬂow.8 Finally, note that the average truck frac-
tion during rush hours was between 10% and 15%
(with a standard deviation of about 5%), and higher
during other time periods (apart from Sundays, which
are truck-free until night). The truck fraction may be
relevant because trucks are allowed to overtake other
vehicles, and their speeds are generally limited to 80
km/h, while speeds of cars are not.
Our further study is based on aggregate double-

loop detector data containing, among other infor-
mation, the arithmetically averaged vehicle veloci-
ties and trafﬁc ﬂows at 30 cross-sections (in direction
North) or 31 cross-sections (in direction South), see
Figure 6. We have preprocessed our one-minute data
by an error correction procedure which is followed
by a smoothing routine. Except for the few times in a
month when none of the detectors recorded any data
for a certain time period due to maintainance work
or a breakdown of the computer facilities, the data
showed very few errors of two types:

8 In many cases, the cars involved can be moved to the emergency
lane and do not block any of the freeway lanes.

Figure 6 Top: Sketch of the Investigated Freeway Section, Showing the Two Directions of the German Three-Lane Freeway A5 Near Frankfurt/Main
Bottom: Height Proﬁle Along the Freeway

Notes. Each measurement cross-section of the freeway is marked by a vertical line. It is named with the initial of the driving direction (“N” for north or “S” for
south), followed by a number increasing in driving direction. The geographical position of each detector is given in kilometers according to the ofﬁcial notation
of the road authorities.

• Sometimes the data of a cross-section consisted
only of error bits for a single minute or two subse-
quent minutes. In this case (amounting to approxi-
mately 1% of the data), we applied a linear interpo-
lation in time. If error bits for time intervals longer
than two minutes were found, all values were set to
zero. After visualization of the data, these events were
clearly visible, because errors of this type occurred
simultaneously for all detectors of a direction.
• In other cases, some detector (measuring a single

lane at a speciﬁc cross-section) failed, which some-
times lasted for a few weeks. When trafﬁc around
this cross-section was congested, we averaged the
data of the other lanes. Because of similar (synchro-
nized) velocities in neighboring lanes during con-
gestion (Kerner and Rehborn 1996b), this procedure
leads to consistent results for the velocity. If there was
free trafﬁc, we interpolated the data of the preceding
cross-section and the following one for the same lane.

5.3. Adaptive Smoothing Method
In our empirical evaluations, we used an adaptive
smoothing algorithm (Treiber and Helbing 2002) as
an alternative to the use of cumulative plots (Newell
1982; Cassidy and Windover 1995; Coifman 2002;

Muñoz and Daganzo 2002b; Bertini et al. 2004).9 This
algorithm gives a good spatiotemporal impression of
trafﬁc patterns based on the data of a few measure-
ment cross-sections. The adaptive smoothing method
uses an exponential ﬁlter "�x� t� that smoothes over
an average time window � and an average spatial
interval # . In this study, we have always chosen
� = 1�2 min and # = 0�6 km. The particular feature
of this method is the smoothing into the respective
propagation direction of perturbations (i.e., along the
“characteristic lines”). In free trafﬁc, perturbations are
assumed to propagate forward (downstream) with a
speed of approximately cfree = 80 kilometers per hour,
while in congested trafﬁc, the perturbations travel
upstream with a speed of about ccong = c0 =−16 kilo-
meters per hour (cf. Figure 7). These values have
been calibrated in a way that minimizes discontinu-
ities in the three-dimensional representation of the
average velocity along the freeway in the course of
time and agree well with other observations (Kerner
and Rehborn 1996a). The adaptive smoothing method
switches automatically between the free and the con-
gested regime based on a certain criterion, so that
there is no subjective element in this method of data
preprocessing; for details, see Treiber and Helbing

9 For an investigation of trafﬁc data from the same freeway stretch,
but with the method of cumulative plots, see Bertini et al. (2004).

(2002). The main properties and advantages of this
method are illustrated by Figure 8.
We have applied this method to the represen-

tation of different quantities such as the average
velocity V �x� t�, its inverse 1/V �x� t�, the trafﬁc ﬂow
Q�x� t�, or the vehicle density determined by ��x� t�=
Q�x� t�/V �x� t�. It turned out that the most intuitive
picture of the trafﬁc situation was obtained by show-
ing the average velocity over space and time, but with
high values on the bottom and small values on the
top. Therefore, this data representation is based on a
quantity that is easy and reliable to measure (in con-
trast to the vehicle density). In the respective plots
of the inverted average speed over location and time,
congestion corresponds to “hills,” similar to a typi-
cal three-dimensional visualization of the density. In
other words, the higher the value on the vertical axis
of the graph, the higher is the resistance to the driver
(the smaller is the velocity).
Furthermore, the method smooths out statistical

ﬂuctuations of the measurements (which are due to
the fact that one-minute data average over a small
number of vehicles only). In this way, the main sys-
tematic features of trafﬁc patterns become more eas-
ily visible. Note that if the assumptions of the LWR
model were true (according to which the ﬂow and
average speed would be a direct function of the
density), perturbations in plots obtained with the
adaptive smoothing method should not grow along
homogeneous freeway sections.

6. Empirical Features of Congested
Trafﬁc States

In the following section, we will discuss different
kinds of spatiotemporal congestion patterns that have

been observed on the investigated section of the Ger-
man freeway A5.

6.1. Pinned Localized Cluster (PLC)
Let us start with a discussion of the particular kind of
spatiotemporal congestion pattern illustrated in Fig-
ure 9. This pattern normally appears during rush
hours at bottlenecks of the freeway such as on-ramps
or gradients and does not move up- or downstream.
Its location is ﬁxed to the location of the bottleneck
and its spatial extension is limited.
Pinned localized clusters (PLC) are characterized by

a localized reduction of velocity and a higher den-
sity.10 They are mostly triggered by a downstream
travelling perturbation (see Figure 9a) or they are
caused by an upstream travelling one that stops at the
location of the bottleneck (see Figure 9b). Upstream
and downstream of the PLC we have free trafﬁc ﬂow.
When the trafﬁc volume becomes too high, PLCs start
to expand in space, which gives rise to other spa-
tially extended congestion patterns (see Figure 20a,
Figure 21b, and §6.8).

6.2. Homogeneous Congested Trafﬁc (HCT)
One kind of spatially extended congested trafﬁc is
homogeneous congested trafﬁc (HCT). We observed
such patterns only after serious accidents or during
holiday trafﬁc. In Figure 10a, for example, we have
diagnosed a complete closing of all three lanes by data
analysis, which has been conﬁrmed by the responsi-
ble road authorities. After a ﬁrst accident occurred at
13:50 at kilometer 477.08, 16 other cars were imme-
diately involved in six subsequent accidents. A quar-
ter of an hour later, two more accidents happened at
about the same position. The congestion pattern in
Figure 10b was also caused by an accident. It occurred
at 19:15 at kilometer 478.736.
In homogeneous congested trafﬁc, the (smoothed)

velocity is very low and more or less constant (i.e.
homogeneous) over a longer section of the freeway.
The downstream front—i.e., the small road section
on which the vehicles accelerate again—is located
slightly downstream of the upstream end of a serious
bottleneck. The upstream jam front moves upstream,
which gives rise to a spatially extended congestion
pattern that grows in time.
Downstream of homogeneous congested trafﬁc, one

usually ﬁnds free trafﬁc. Once the bottleneck is
removed (e.g., the accident and the lanes blocked by it
are cleared), the downstream front of congested traf-
ﬁc moves upstream with a speed C, which normally

10 This speed reduction is probably a result of interaction-based
obstruction effects, e.g., due to weaving ﬂows—i.e., frequent lane
changes close to freeway ramps.

ance can, in principle, be forecasted when the clearing
time and the time-dependent upstream ﬂow Qup�t�

Notes. For a detailed discussion of the congestion pattern displayed in (a), see §6.8. The pinned localized cluster shown in (b) is triggered by a boomerang
effect (see §2.5). The PLC state starts at 7:03 a.m., when a large perturbation travelling with the speed −18�26 km/h reaches the on-ramp at kilometer 481.3
(cross-section S15).

6.3. Oscillating Congested Trafﬁc (OCT)
Oscillating congested trafﬁc is another kind of
extended congestion pattern. It has similar features to
homogeneous congested trafﬁc regarding its develop-
ment, growth, and dissolution mechanism. However,
the congested area shows more or less regular oscil-

Figure 10 Two Representative Examples of Homogeneous Congested Trafﬁc Caused by Accidents
Notes. In (a), the freeway is effectively blocked because the outﬂow reaching the intersection at cross-section S14 is only 90 vehicles per hour and lane. The
initial mean speed of the upstream shockwave is C1 = −�7�87± 0�27� km/h, until it reaches the second on-ramp of Junction Friedberg at kilometer 471.5.
Further upstream, after 2 p.m., it is C2 =−�4�15± 0�11� km/h. The speed of the downstream congestion front is c1 =−�24�18± 2�27� km/h on the section
between kilometer 476.5 and 471.5; further upstream it is c2 =−�12�42± 0�24� km/h. In (b), a pinned localized cluster with smaller density persists for some
time after the accident site is cleared, possibly because of continuing efforts in the emergency lane. The speed of the upstream shockwave between kilometer
478.7 and km 473.0 is C1 =−10�5±0�4 km/h; later on, from kilometer 470.69 to 465.15 it is C2 =−�8�20±0�24� km/h. The speed of the downstream shock
front between kilometer 477.4 and 473.0 amounts to c1 =−�13�01± 0�35� km/h. Later on, from kilometer 470.69 to 465.15 it is c2 =−�16�31± 1�09� km/h.
While the speeds of the upstream shock fronts are expected to vary according to Equation (6), the change in the speed of the downstream shock front is
unexpected. We suggest that this may be due to a higher maximum density �jam or time gap T along the gradient of the freeway.

lations of speed with a frequency and amplitude that
stay roughly constant over a certain period of time.
The oscillations propagate upstream with a velocity
c≈ ccong =−16 km/h, cf. Figure 11.
Oscillating congested trafﬁc is often surrounded by

free trafﬁc ﬂow and may be triggered by a pertur-
bation, but it can also arise when the trafﬁc volume
exceeds a certain value. There are two different disso-
lution mechanisms:
• If a temporary bottleneck is lifted (e.g., an acci-

dent site is cleared), the freeway section can again
cope with the overall trafﬁc volume and the bottle-
neck becomes inactivated. In this case, the down-
stream congestion front starts to move upstream with
a speed c ≈ c0 = ccong, until the upstream front is

Notes. (a) This congestion pattern is caused by an accident at kilometer 478.325 at 9:50 a.m.. The mean propagation velocity of the 12 stop waves is c¯ =
15�7± 1�2 km/h, and the standard errors in the determination of the velocities of the individual stop waves vary between 0.1 and 1.2 km/h. (b) This oscillating
congested trafﬁc is the result of an obstruction on the fast lane between kilometers 486.0 and 486.9. The mean propagation velocity of the 11 large stop waves
amounts to c¯= 17�6± 1�4 km/h.

reached and the congestion is thereby dissolved (see
Figure 11a).
• If the time-dependent upstream ﬂow Qup

becomes smaller than Qcong, the vehicle queue shrinks
and the upstream congestion front moves down-
stream. If  Q stays long enough above zero, the
upstream front will ﬁnally reach the bottleneck, ter-
minating the congestion.

6.4. Stop-and-Go Waves (SGW)
Another form of congested trafﬁc, which has spatially
extended and localized features at the same time,
are stop-and-go waves. They are related to oscillat-
ing congested trafﬁc, but have a large characteristic
amplitude, while there is no typical wavelength. Stop-
and-go waves (SGW) consist of a sequence of trafﬁc

Notes. See Figure 14 for the measurement method. In (a), stop-and-go
waves appear between 14:30 and 16:10 at the uphill gradient, generating a
ﬂow-conserving bottleneck between kilometer 475 and kilometer 477 (see
Figure 6). The interruption of the waves at 16:20 is caused by an accident at
kilometer 482.8. (b) The stop-and-go waves are created at the uphill gradi-
ent “Köpperner Berg” between kilometer 474 and kilometer 472 from 14:00
to 15:10. In both cases, the stop-and-go waves disappear at Intersection
Frankfurt West due to several off-ramps.

jams with free trafﬁc in between. The trafﬁc jams are
localized (i.e., spatially conﬁned in space and time),
and they propagate upstream from the generating
bottleneck with a velocity of ccong ≈ −16 km/h. The
spatial and temporal distance between two succes-
sive trafﬁc jams vary signiﬁcantly. Stop-and-go waves
are sometimes triggered by small perturbations in the
trafﬁc ﬂow or may originate from an area of pinned
localized clusters. (see Figures 12, 20, 21, and §6.7).
The propagation speed of stop-and-go waves does
not change when they travel through pinned localized
clusters (see Figures 20b, 21a) or spatially extended
congested trafﬁc (Kerner 2000a, b, 2002b; Helbing
et al. 2003). Their propagation typically ends in free
trafﬁc, mostly when passing off-ramps.

6.5. Moving Localized Cluster (MLC)
In the case of a single moving trafﬁc jam (instead of
a sequence of them), we talk about a moving local-
ized cluster (MLC). As for a PLC the width of an
MLC state is limited, but MLC is propagating with
the speed ccong ≈ −16 km/h rather than staying at a
particular place.

Figure 13 Representative Examples of Moving Localized Clusters
Notes. In (a), the MLC state emerges at the uphill gradient Köpperner Berg
(kilometer 474 to kilometer 472, cf. Figure 6). The velocity of the stop wave
is c = �−18�0± 0�2� km/h, which has been determined as described in the
caption of Figure 2. (b) At 7:10 a.m., the moving localized cluster is triggered
at kilometer 488 by a “boomerang effect” (see §2.5). The triggering is due to
a peak in the ﬂow at kilometer 486.9 (cross-section S21) between 7:01 a.m.
and 7:06 a.m. with a value of 2,178 veh/h/lane, which is probably caused by
a platoon of cars behind some overtaking trucks. Note that when passing the
Intersection Bad Homburg at kilometer 481, the MLC state meets a small,
downstream moving perturbation that initiates a PLC state at the on-ramp.

An MLC state usually originates at a bottleneck
from a (large) perturbation of trafﬁc ﬂow. One can
distinguish two different cases:
• The perturbation is large enough to travel

upstream from the very beginning (see Figure 13a).
• The perturbation approaches from upstream and

appears in the form of a high-ﬂow time interval that
initiates a growing, upstream traveling moving local-
ized cluster when arriving at a bottleneck, see Fig-
ure 13a at kilometer 473 and Figure 13b at kilometer
488. Normally, this high-ﬂow time interval is very dis-
tinct (Figure 13b) and a boomerang effect (see §2.5)
can easily be observed. If the high ﬂow at the bottle-
neck persists for a longer time period, it is more likely
to observe a stop-and-go wave pattern or multiple
MLC states rather than a single MLC; see Figure 12.

6.6. Empirical Phase Diagram
In contrast to previous evaluations (Schönhof and
Helbing 2004; Helbing et al. 2003), the following
results were obtained with a semiautomated measure-
ment method, which is described in Figure 14. The

Figure 14 The Bottleneck Strength �Q and the Upstream Flow Qup on the Freeway as the Quantities Required for Generating the Empirical Phase
Diagram Were Measured by Averaging Flow Values Over a Certain Time Window, Depending on the Type of Congestion

Notes. As a trapeziform weight function reduces the sensitivity to the beginning and end of the time window, we have weighted values inside the time window
with 1, the boundary values with 2/3, and the closest values outside of the time window with 1/3. (a) Pinned localized clusters at Junction Friedberg, see (d),
were often triggered by peaks in the ﬂow, but very soon after the trafﬁc breakdown a stationary state occurred, where congestion was spread over the whole
junction and the cross-section S4 at km 470 was situated inside the congested area. In this stationary state, the actual bottleneck strength was assumed to
be the net ramp inﬂow �Q=max��Q1on − �Q1off�0�+max��Q2on − �Q2off�0�. The cross-sections directly upstream of the bottleneck (S4, S3) suffered from the
congestion and displayed larger ﬂuctuations. Therefore, the upstream ﬂow was measured ≈ 3 km further upstream at cross-section S2 (kilometer 466.65) for
the same time window as the bottleneck strength �Q, exploiting that the travel time between S2 and the junction is negligible and the number of vehicles on
this freeway section is conserved. The time window was chosen as the interval during which the congestion (involving detector S4) was stationary. It was also
the basis for the measurement of the outﬂow Qout at cross-section S6. (b) The inﬂow Qup to a moving localized cluster was averaged over a time interval of
20-minutes, ending at the time when the velocity at cross-section S2 dropped below 90 km/h. The bottleneck strength was determined with the above formula
for �Q, averaging over a 20-minute window centered at the time, when the moving localized cluster entered the junction, i.e., when the velocity at cross-section
S6 exceeded 60 km/h again. The ouﬂow was measured at cross-section S6 during the 20 minutes after the jam passed the junction, i.e., the velocity at S4
exceeded 60 km/h again. (c) For stop-and-go waves and oscillating congested trafﬁc, Qup was determined as for moving localized clusters, while �Q and Qout
were obtained as for pinned localized clusters. For the averaging time window we chose the period during which the congestion pattern had its characteristic
form, i.e., the moments of high initial ﬂows triggering the congestion patterns (see short thick line, “onset of congestion”) did not enter into our measurements.
This method differs from our previous measurement method (Schönhof and Helbing 2004; Helbing et al. 2003), in which we focussed on the initial ﬂows.
Finally, outﬂows Qhinderedout of ﬂow-conserving bottlenecks at accident sites were measured at the next downstream cross-section during the obstruction period.
The reference outﬂow Qout, measured at this place immediately after the velocity increased again (after the accident was cleared), was used to estimate the
bottleneck strength via �Q≈ Qout −Qhinderedout .

empirical phase diagram for the congestion patterns
at Junction Friedberg that are depicted in Figure 15,
and the observed ﬂows for the (other) congestion pat-
terns presented in the different ﬁgures throughout
this paper, are surprisingly well compatible with the
theoretical one (see Figure 4):
• For values of the overall ﬂow Qtot = Qup +

Qrmp/�nL� below 1,400 vehicles per hour and lane,
trafﬁc is always free, while above 2,100 vehicles per
hour and lane, it is always congested.
• MLC occur for upstream ﬂows above 1,400 vehi-

cles per hour and lane and for overall ﬂows Qtot
below 1,800 vehicles per hour and lane.

• For 1,800 veh/h/lane≤Qtot ≤ 2�100 veh/h/lane
and Qup ≥ 1�400 veh/h/lane, we ﬁnd a coexistence of
FT, OCT, and SGWs.
• HCT is only found after serious accidents with

lane closures, with a bottleneck strength  Q ≥ 700
vehicles per hour and lane, cf. Figures 8, 10, and
21b. Homogeneous congested trafﬁc has not been
observed upstream of Junction Friedberg (i.e. its most
upstream located off-ramp).
Although altogether there is a good agreement

between the theoretical and empirical trafﬁc states,
and the empirical phase diagram is qualitatively
compatible with the theoretical phase diagram, we

Figure 15 Comparison of the Theoretical and Empirical Phase Diagram
Notes. (a) The superposition of the theoretical phase diagrams of the nonlocal GKT model for negligible and large perturbations (see Figure 4) illustrates
the multistable nature of trafﬁc ﬂows (see §4.2). (For the possible existence of PLC states up to Qtot = Qmax see Footnote 6.) (b) Phase points of empirically
observed trafﬁc states at the Junction Friedberg as a function of the effective ramp ﬂow �Q per freeway lane and the upstream freeway ﬂow Qup (F = free
trafﬁc, M=moving localized cluster, S= stop-and-go waves, O= oscillating congested trafﬁc, P= pinned localized clusters).

The ﬂows were measured as described in Figure 14, and free trafﬁc was evaluated over a 20-minute interval before the ﬂow broke down, starting 40 minutes
before the velocity dropped below 90 km/h at cross-section S5. Solid lines are guides to the eyes to support a comparison with the theoretical phase diagram
displayed in (a). The dashed lines B1 and B2 reﬂect the empirical variation of the value of the outﬂow Qout from congested trafﬁc, see Figure 17.

want to mention one inconsistency: There are a few
PLC states with on overall ﬂow Qtot above 1,800
veh/h/lane. This can have several reasons:
1. The PLC state may be incorrectly classiﬁed: If

Qtot = Qup +  Q ≈ Qout, the difference between the
upstream ﬂow Qup and the ﬂow Qcong = Qout −  Q
in the congested area is small (of the order of 100
vehicles per hour and lane). As a consequence, the
upstream congestion front moves very slowly (see
Equation (6) and the discussion of Figure 9a in §6.8).
Therefore, within the time period of the rush hour,
the congestion front may not reach the next upstream
detector, which is about one kilometer away. In con-
clusion, the trafﬁc states with a total ﬂow greater than
1,800 veh/h/lane that were classiﬁed as PLC states
are potentially extended congested trafﬁc states for
which the upstream front did not reach the next detec-
tor before the end of the rush hour.
2. The outﬂow Qout from congested trafﬁc varies

considerably for all congested trafﬁc states (see Fig-
ure 17a), which implies that line B representing the
condition Qtot = Qout in the phase diagram must
instead be replaced by an area delimited by a lower
line B1 and an upper line B2. In fact, scaling the
ﬂows underlying the phase diagram by the empiri-
cally measured outﬂow Qout gives a very clear pic-
ture: The nonextended trafﬁc states are then scattered
around the line Qup/Qout +  Q/Qout = 1, while the
extended trafﬁc states are above this line (see Fig-
ure 16), as expected.

The clearer separation of different congested trafﬁc
states after the scaling with the outﬂows Qout indi-
cates the importance of understanding the varying
outﬂows Qout. In fact, the relationship

Qout =Qcong�Vcong�+ Q (23)
suggests that Qout could be speciﬁed as a function
of the average speed Vcong in the congested area. In
other words, the capacity drop would be lower the
higher the vehicle speed in the congested area is,
which sounds plausible.
Figure 17 supports this interpretation: First, the

empirical relationship Qcong�Vcong� is quite compatible
with the theoretical relationship

Qcong�Vcong�=
�max�c�

1+ �c�/Vcong
(24)

that would follow from the“jam line”

Qcong���=
1
T

(
1− �

�max

)
(25)

and Vcong��� = Qcong���/�. Here, �max again denotes
the maximum vehicle density per lane, �c� = 16 km/h
the propagation speed of a downstream congestion
front, and T = 1/�max/�c� the safe time gap. Second,
Qout clearly grows with the average speed Vcong in the
congested area (see Figure 17a). Third, Figure 17b sug-
gests that the ﬂow Qcong = Qout −  Q� and therefore

Figure 16 Empirical Phase Diagrams, Where the Flows Have Been Scaled by the Respective Outﬂows Qout (See Figure 14 for the Measurement
Method)

Notes. Illustration (a) shows the congested trafﬁc states observed at Junction Friedberg in direction South, while (b) illustrates the ﬂows corresponding to the
trafﬁc states displayed in the ﬁgures throughout this paper (M=moving localized cluster, S= stop-and-go waves, O= oscillating congested trafﬁc, P= pinned
localized clusters). It can be clearly seen that the nonextended trafﬁc states are scattered around the line Qup/Qout + �Q/Qout = 1, as expected, whereas the
extended trafﬁc states are above this line. Moreover, pinned localized clusters, moving localized clusters, stop-and-go waves/oscillating congested trafﬁc, and
homogeneous congested trafﬁc are well separated from each other.

Qout itself, tends to increase with the sum of the off-
ramp ﬂows  Qoff > 0 along Junction Friedberg and
with the on-ramp ﬂow  Q1on of the ﬁrst on-ramp. In
accordance with observations, this surprising result
suggests that it is not correct to treat all the freeway
lanes in the same way.
Rather, the left lane is used by vehicles passing

the junction, while the right lane is mainly used by
vehicles entering and leaving along Junction Fried-
berg, and by trucks. The middle lane is characterized
by mixed use. Considering this, it becomes under-
standable that the off-ramp ﬂows can increase the
outﬂow Qout as they leave gaps between the vehicles
remaining on the right lane, which facilitate entering
the right and middle lanes of the freeway. The on-
ramp ﬂow  Q1on of the ﬁrst on-ramp seems to increase
the outﬂow further downstream, as it enhances the
ﬂow separation between the right lane and the other
two lanes. This particularly underscores that Junction
Friedberg cannot be treated like an isolated bottle-
neck, in contrast to Kerner’s view (2002b). Rather, it
is understandable only by a detailed analysis of the
interactions between several on- and off-ramps. Dur-
ing congested time periods, Junction Friedberg has
to cope with an overall on-ramp ﬂow of as much as
1,700 veh/h (which requires the capacity of at least
one full lane), while the overall off-ramp ﬂow is only
375 veh/h.

6.7. Spatial Transitions Between Different
Congestion States and “Pinch Effect”

Freeways are not at all spatially homogeneous. Due to
the existence of on- and off-ramps, gradients, curves,

etc., a freeway is composed of road sections of differ-
ent capacities, even if the number of lanes is constant.
If the capacity is reduced from one road section to the
next one in a downstream direction, we speak of a
bottleneck. Upstream of bottlenecks, there is a danger
of queue formation or congestion if the trafﬁc volume
becomes too high, while downstream of the upstream
end of a bottleneck, one mostly observes free traf-
ﬁc if there is not another activated bottleneck further
downstream.
The phase diagrams depicted in Figure 4 assume

only a single bottleneck. In principle, however, phase
diagrams could also be generated for more com-
plex freeway geometries with several bottlenecks.
These would be multidimensional (with one addi-
tional dimension per bottleneck). For this reason,
there are many more possibilities for classifying dif-
ferent congested trafﬁc states for freeways with sev-
eral bottlenecks. In the simplest case, particularly for
largely separated bottlenecks, these states would just
correspond to the possible combinations of the six
trafﬁc states occurring at a single bottleneck, namely
FT, PLC, MLC, SGW, OCT, and HCT. It could, how-
ever, happen that spatially extended trafﬁc states
inﬂuence the bottlenecks and trafﬁc states upstream
due to spillover effects.
For illustration, let us focus here on the combina-

tion of an on-ramp with an off-ramp further upstream
(see Figure 18 for a sketch). This freeway design is
often chosen to reduce the magnitude of trafﬁc break-
downs, because it is favorable when vehicles leave the
freeway before new ones enter. What would a bottle-
neck analysis analogous to the one in §4.2 predict for

Figure 17 Trafﬁc Flows at Junction Friedberg During Congestion
Notes. (a) The outﬂows Qout and the upstream congested ﬂow Qcong for the PLC, SGW, and OCT states (represented by ×= P, S, and O, respectively) at
Junction Friedberg depend on the average velocity Vcong in the congested area. With a maximum density of �max = 109 veh/km/lane, the average dependence
Qcong�Vcong� is well consistent with theoretically predicted formula (24). (b) The ﬂow Qcong at Junction Friedberg tends to grow with the sum of the off-ramp
ﬂows �Qoff > 0 and the on-ramp ﬂow of the ﬁrst on-ramp denoted by �Q1on. The dashed line serves as guide for the eye and has the slope +2. The subsequent
on- and off-ramp ﬂows obviously facilitate a higher average velocity of the vehicles and a higher trafﬁc efﬁciency within the congestion area (see main text).

this setup? In order to discuss this, let us again denote
the outﬂow capacity downstream of the on-ramp by
Qout, its bottleneck strength equivalent to the on-ramp
ﬂow Qrmp by  Qon = Qrmp/n > 0, the upstream ﬂow
by Qup, and the average congested ﬂow resulting
immediately upstream of the on-ramp by Qcong. In
contrast, we will denote the same quantities relating
to the area of the off-ramp by primes (′), but we will
introduce the abbreviation − Qoff =−Q′rmp/n′ < 0 for
the effect of the off-ramp ﬂow Q′rmp > 0.

Notes. Trafﬁc ﬂow is from left to right. (a) When the upstream ﬂow Q ′up
upstream of the off-ramp minus the off-ramp ﬂow �Qoff exceeds the outﬂow
Qout from congested trafﬁc minus the on-ramp ﬂow �Qon, congested trafﬁc
upstream of the on-ramp (grey area) is expected to grow. (b) As soon as
the congested area extends up to the location of the off-ramp, the off-ramp
bottleneck is activated. Its outﬂow Q ′out is given by the congested ﬂow Qcong
upstream of the on-ramp, while the congested ﬂow Q ′cong upstream of the
off-ramp is higher by the amount �Qoff corresponding to the off-ramp ﬂow.
The ﬂow upstream of the congestion and the off-ramp is denoted by Q ′up.

We expect the following dynamics: Trafﬁc will
break down at the on-ramp bottleneck ﬁrst. If Qup >
Qcong = Qout −  Qon, we will have a growing area
of extended congested trafﬁc, and it will eventually
reach the location of the off-ramp (cf. Figure 18a).
What will happen there? From that time on, when the
off-ramp is completely congested (cf. Figure 18b), the
capacity downstream of the off-ramp will suddenly
go down from Q′out =Qout to the congested ﬂow

Q′out =Qcong =Qout− Qon (26)
due to a spillover effect. This abrupt change in the
bottleneck capacity restricts the capacity upstream of
the off-ramp to Qcong+ Qoff. For Qcong+ Qoff <Qout,
a bottleneck at this position exists, and its effective
strength  Q is given by the difference

 Q=Qout− �Qcong+ Qoff�= Qon− Qoff (27)
of these values, because this is the amount of out-
ﬂow from congested trafﬁc that cannot be served by
the off-ramp and the downstream freeway ﬂow. For
Qcong + Qoff >Qout, no bottleneck occurs, which cor-
responds to a bottleneck strength  Q= 0. This ﬁnally
results in the expression

Figure 19 Flow Data for the Different Subbottlenecks of Junction Friedberg in Direction South (See Figure 14d)
Notes. According to our theory, congestion patterns upstream of the off-ramp at kilometer 470 are expected when all subbottlenecks of the whole effective
bottleneck between cross-sections S4 and S6 suffer from extended congested trafﬁc, speciﬁcally the on-ramp upstream of cross-section S6 (subbottleneck 1),
the combination of this on-ramp with the upstream off-ramp (subbottleneck 2), and their combination with the next on-ramp upstream (subbottleneck 3).
For this, the corresponding values of Qup + �Q should all be located above the diagonal corresponding to Qup + �Q = Qout (solid line). This is actually the
case for the majority of data points, and the remaining points are still within the area of possible outﬂows from extended congestion states (Qtot > 1�600
veh/h/lane, cf. Figure 17a). In fact, after the ﬁrst signs of a trafﬁc breakdown (namely, reduced speeds at kilometer 471.55, i.e., cross-section S6), congestion
at Junction Friedberg spreads very rapidly and typically extends over the whole junction up to cross-section S4 at kilometer 469.9 within a few minutes. The
ﬂow measurements at the subbottlenecks were made as follows: The inﬂow Qup and the bottleneck strength �Q were determined over a time window of 10
minutes directly before the velocity dropped below 90 km/h at cross-section S5. The upstream ﬂow Q3rd subup of the 3rd subbottleneck was obtained by the ﬂow
measured at cross-section S5. Because there are no detectors to measure the upstream ﬂows Qup of the 1st and 2nd subbottlenecks directly, we applied the
formulas Q2nd subup = QS5+�Q1on and Q1st subup = QS5+�Q1on−�Q2off (see Figure 14d, where the bottleneck strength �Q for the subbottlenecks is also deﬁned).

resulting congested ﬂow upstream of the off-ramp is
expected to be

Q′cong = Q′out+ Qoff =Qout− Qon+ Qoff
= Qout− Q=Qcong+ Qoff� (29)

Moreover, we ﬁnd

Q′up−Qup = Qoff =Q′cong−Qcong� (30)
In conclusion, if congested trafﬁc upstream of an on-
ramp reaches an upstream off-ramp, the off-ramp
becomes a bottleneck of strength  Q, which is given
by the difference between the on-ramp and the off-
ramp ﬂows (or zero, if this difference would be nega-
tive). Figure 19 illustrates the validity of this picture.11

Because  Q≤ Qon according to Equation (28), and
because of Q′cong ≥ Qcong according to Equation (29),
the congestion upstream of the off-ramp is expected

11 At Junction Friedberg and Intersection Bad Homburg, the situa-
tion is actually even more complicated, because these are made up
of a series of several on- and off-ramps; see Figures 6 and 14d. How-
ever, the ﬂow balance is again expected to determine the effective
bottleneck strength  Q as long as the resulting values are nonneg-
ative (otherwise, the off-ramp bottleneck is deactivated).

to be milder than the congestion upstream of the
on-ramp. Note, however, that in reality the situa-
tion becomes more complicated due to the following
effects: On the one hand, spatially extended conges-
tion upstream of the on-ramp, depending on the off-
ramp and upstream ﬂows, may pass the location of
the off-ramp. This will obstruct the ﬂow of depart-
ing vehicles, i.e., reduce the off-ramp ﬂow  Qoff com-
pared to the situation with free ﬂow at the off-ramp.
On the other hand, congested trafﬁc upstream of the
off-ramp will motivate a larger fraction of drivers to
leave the freeway once they reach the off-ramp. This
may adjust the bottleneck strength of the off-ramp
bottleneck in such a way that the upstream conges-
tion front ﬂuctuates around the upstream end of the
off-ramp (cf. the discussion of Figure 20b in §6.9).
The ﬂuctuation and the resulting ﬂips of  Q can be
a source of oscillatory dynamics upstream of the off-
ramp, which is often observed (see Figures 8, 20,
and 21a).
The above considerations suggest a new interpre-

tation of the “pinch effect” or the “general pattern,”
respectively, the “general pattern” (Kerner 1998a;
2002a, b): After 7:00 a.m., Figure 20a shows a conges-
tion pattern at the on-ramp of Intersection Bad Hom-
burg at kilometer 481.3, which until 7:40 a.m. looks

Figure 20 Empirical Example of the “Pinch Effect”
Notes. (a) Representative example of the “pinch effect” upstream of Intersection Bad Homburg at kilometer 481. One can clearly see the typical spatial
sequence of homogeneous congested, oscillating congested, and stop-and-go trafﬁc in upstream direction. (b) In this similarly looking congestion pattern,
two stop-and-go waves pass the next bottleneck Junction Friedberg at kilometer 471, grow wider over there, and continue with a slightly changed velocity
(15�6± 0�3 km/h compared to 18�0± 0�5 km/h for the ﬁrst stop wave and 15�2± 0�5 km/h compared to 16�2± 0�4 km/h for the second).

like a PLC. This classiﬁcation ﬁts with the overall bot-
tleneck strength  Q = 606 veh/h/lane for the two
on-ramps and the inﬂow of Qup = 1�100 veh/h/lane
(values averaged over the time interval 7:10 a.m. to
7:40 a.m.). However, for this time interval, the out-
ﬂow at cross-section S16 downstream of the Intersec-
tion Bad Homburg is only Qout = 1�568 veh/h/lane.
Thus, the total inﬂow of Qtot = Qup +  Q = 1�706
veh/h/lane actually leads to a slowly growing con-
gestion pattern with the appearance of oscillating
or even homogeneous congested trafﬁc (the veloci-
ties within the congested area ﬂuctuate between 10
km/h and 30 km/h). At 7:53 a.m., the velocity drops
at cross-section S11, indicating that the whole inter-
section is congested and that the off-ramp bottle-
neck is activated. For this new situation, the inﬂow
(measured three kilometer upstream at cross-section
S8 as described in Figure 14c) is given by Qup =
1�487 veh/h/lane, and the bottleneck strength by
 Q = 206 veh/h/lane (averaged over the next hour,

see Figure 14c). The point in the phase diagram is
located inside the MLC region, but relative to the low
outﬂow of Qout = 1�616 veh/h/lane (see Figure 16),
the point instead corresponds to stop-and-go waves,
as observed. While travelling upstream, some of these
waves vanish due to the small upstream ﬂow of
1,487 veh/h/lane, whereas one of them persists. This
surviving SGW enters another area of congested traf-
ﬁc upstream of Junction Friedberg at kilometer 471.5.
Note that around kilometer 478, we do not really see a
merging of small oscillations in favor of a few remain-
ing moving trafﬁc jams, in contrast to the suggestion
by Kerner (1998a). Rather, the oscillations seem to dis-
appear, i.e., they seem to be dissolved in free trafﬁc.
Although Kerner views the pinch effect as a fea-

ture of a general pattern of congestion (Kerner 2002b),
we did not frequently observe it. The dissolution or
merging of narrow jams does not occur very often.
This may be due to the applied smoothing proce-
dure. Structures on a smaller scale than # = 0�6 km

may actually merge, but from our point of view, it is
hard to tell them apart from ﬂuctuations. Therefore,
we instead propose to interpret the pinch effect as
result of the particular dynamics generated at a bot-
tleneck composed of subsequent off- and on-ramps,
as explained above.

6.8. Transitions Between Congested Trafﬁc
States in Time

Due to the metastability of trafﬁc ﬂows, transitions
between different congested trafﬁc states in time, but
at the same bottleneck, do not occur frequently. Nev-
ertheless, the phase diagram predicts the possibility
of such transitions. Normally, in the absence of large
perturbations (see Figure 4a) we expect a direct tran-
sition from free ﬂow to spatially extended congested
trafﬁc when the overall trafﬁc ﬂow Qtot increases. This
mostly implies a direct transition from free to OCT
or SGWs, which may sometimes be hard to distin-
guish empirically. Homogeneous congested trafﬁc is
only expected when a bottleneck becomes extremely
large, as for accidents with lane closures or major hol-
iday trafﬁc. If an accident site is lifted during the rush
hour, an HCT state may become an OCT or SGW
state (see Figure 8). In cases where the total ﬂow Qtot
exceeds a certain value, a PLC should be able to grow
and to generate an extended form of congestion (see
Figure 21a at km 471.5). The opposite should also be
possible if the ﬂow goes down (see Figure 8).
As an example for more complex transitions in

time, let us discuss Figure 9a in detail: At 7:56 a.m.,
the trafﬁc breaks down at the on-ramp of Junction
Bad Homburg. Due to a queueing process, the con-
gested area extends, and at 8:15 a.m. reaches cross-
section S13 at kilometer 480. During this time interval,
the total ﬂow should exceed the outﬂow, i.e., Qtot >
Qout. The upstream ﬂow is given by the inﬂow mea-
sured at cross-section S11 minus the off-ramp ﬂow at
km 480.8. It amounts to Qup = 1�750 veh/h/lane −
484 veh/h/lane = 1�266 veh/h/lane. The bottleneck
strength  Q = 693/h/lane is determined by divid-
ing the on-ramp ﬂow by the number of freeway
lanes. For these ﬂow values, the phase diagram pre-
dicts oscillating or even homogeneous congested traf-
ﬁc. The difference between the total ﬂow Qtot =
Qup+ Q = 1�959 veh/h/lane and the measured out-
ﬂow at cross-section S16 of 1,766 veh/h/lane causes
the upstream congestion front to expand by a dis-
tance of 1,300m in 20 minutes. Between 8:15 a.m.
and 8:55 a.m., it travels from cross-section S13 to
S12. During this time period, there is a stationary
phase from 8:30 a.m. to 8:50 a.m., where the total
ﬂow Qtot =Qup+ Q = 1�893 veh/h/lane matches the
outﬂow Qout = 1�899 veh/h/lane. The correspond-
ing upstream ﬂow and bottleneck strength are Qup =
1�180 veh/h/lane and  Q= 713 veh/h/lane, respec-
tively. In Figure 16b, this state has been classiﬁed

as PLC, although it may also be interpreted as a
homogeneous congested trafﬁc state that is station-
ary, i.e., not extending any further. The reason for the
upstream jam front to cross-section S12 and to ﬁnally
arrive at cross-section S11 at 9:05 a.m. is a ﬂuctua-
tion of the inﬂow (Q8�55−9�05 a.m.S11 = 1�901 veh/h/lane >
Q8�30−8�50 a.m.S11 = 1�765 veh/h/lane). After the off-ramp
bottleneck is activated around 9:00 a.m., its upstream
ﬂow Qup = 1�867 veh/h/lane and the resulting over-
all bottleneck strength  Q = 55 veh/h/lane allow a
light SGW state during the next 10 minutes. However,
after the ﬁrst SGW has passed cross-section S11, the
ﬂow values of Qup and  Q have already decreased
and lead to a slow dissolution of congestion rather
than persistent SGW.

6.9. Combinations of Different Congestion States
Along the Freeway

Congestion normally starts to form upstream of the
freeway section for which the difference between the
arriving trafﬁc volume and the section capacity (bot-
tleneck capacity) is highest. With increasing trafﬁc
volume, more and more bottlenecks are activated.
Therefore, we normally have a sequence of differ-
ent congested trafﬁc patterns along the freeway, and
the spatiotemporal patterns are given by interactions
between different bottlenecks. The bottlenecks inﬂu-
ence each other in a downstream direction by deter-
mining the upstream ﬂow of the next bottleneck, and
in an upstream direction by the propagation of con-
gested trafﬁc patterns (spillback effects). In the fol-
lowing, we will discuss several examples.
Let us start with the trafﬁc pattern shown in Fig-

ure 20b. There, a boomerang effect (see §2.5) trig-
gers an MLC at about 6:55 a.m. Around 7:10 a.m.,
this MLC state arrives at kilometer 481.3 (cross-section
S15 of Intersection Bad Homburg), where it triggers
a PLC at the location of the on-ramp, which even-
tually extends over the whole intersection ( Q= 698
veh/h/lane). Within the next hours, the upstream
front of the localized cluster ﬂuctuates between cross-
section S12 (which is always congested after 7:50 a.m.)
and cross-section S11 upstream of the long off-ramp,
where the velocity stays, overall, above 80 km/h,
apart from the times when an MLC passes. It seems
that by ﬂuctuations in the upstream ﬂow, the off-
ramp bottleneck is alternately activated and deacti-
vated (see §6.7). The bottleneck strength between 7:20
a.m. and 9:40 a.m. is given by  Q =  Qon −  Qoff ≈
187 veh/h/lane and the upstream ﬂow (measured
before the ﬁrst SGW at cross-section S8 from 7:19
a.m. to 7:38 a.m.) amounts to Qup = 1�791 veh/h/lane,
which falls into the area of SGW/OCT states (see Fig-
ure 16b). Around 9:00 a.m., when the morning rush

hour calms down, some of the SGW and the conges-
tion at kilometer 471 (Junction Friedberg) start to dis-
appear, whereas the congestion at kilometer 480 (at
Intersection Bad Homburg) persists even longer.
We will now continue with Figure 8. According

to police reports, at 7:20 a.m. an accident occurred
at kilometer 483.1. This accident is clearly visible in
the data, because the downstream front of the jam
is located between the cross-sections S17 (km 483.0)
and S18 (km 484.1), where the freeway usually has
no bottleneck. In our data, the ﬂow at cross-section
S17, along with the velocity, dropped at 7:08 a.m.,
whereas the ﬂow drop at cross-section S18 occurred
one minute later. This is a strong hint that the time
of the accident was not reported exactly. During the
ﬁrst half hour after the accident (7:10 a.m. to 7:40
a.m.), the outﬂow was 1,231 veh/h/lane. This very
light trafﬁc resulted in high velocities downstream of
the accident location, which can be seen in the plots.
Between 7:40 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., the outﬂow reached
normal values again (1,781 veh/h/lane). Between 7:10
a.m. and 7:40 a.m., the bottleneck strength was esti-
mated as  Q = Qnormalout − Qhinderedout = �1�781 − 1�231�
veh/h/lane= 550 veh/h/lane. At 9:00 a.m., the bot-
tleneck forming the downstream congestion front
moved from the accident site at kilometer 483.1 to
the on-ramp of the Intersection Bad Homburg fur-
ther upstream (cross-section S15 at kilometer 481.3).
The inﬂow measured between 6:48 a.m. and 7:07 a.m.
at cross-section S16 (kilometer 482.2), before conges-
tion reached this point, was Qup = 1�971 veh/h/lane.
According to the phase diagram, these ﬂows are
related to oscillating congested trafﬁc in the neigh-
borhood of homogeneous congested trafﬁc. Upstream
of the accident site at cross-section S16, the aver-
age velocities of the three lanes ﬂuctuate between 12
km/h and 35 km/h, upstream of the Intersection Bad
Homburg the ﬂuctuations become larger, resulting in
clear oscillating congested trafﬁc. The ﬂow conditions
of the subsequent SGWs and PLC states are displayed
in Figure 16b.
Figure 21a shows the breakdown of free trafﬁc

ﬂow at kilometer 471.5 (Junction Friedberg). Conges-
tion starts at the second on-ramp at 6:23 a.m. with a
velocity drop at cross-section S6. Five minutes later,
the velocity upstream of the ﬁrst on-ramp at cross-
section S4 breaks down as well, and the junction is
completely congested. After 10 more minutes, dur-
ing which the bottleneck strength increases, SGW
are ﬁnally formed (see §6.7). At about 7:50 a.m., we
observe the formation of a moving localized clus-
ter around kilometer 486 at the off-ramp of Inter-
section Frankfurt North-West, which is triggered by
the boomerang effect (see §2.5). The MLC turns into
a PLC when it reaches cross-section S14 (Intersec-
tion Bad Homburg) at 8:10 a.m. because of the small

inﬂow: From 8:00 a.m. to 8:10 a.m., the upstream
ﬂow Qup measured at cross-section S13 is just 1,079
veh/h/lane, as many vehicles are leaving over the
off-ramp located there (see Figure 6). However, the
following freeway ﬂow (8:10 a.m. to 8:30 a.m.) at this
cross-section of 1,266 veh/h/lane and the effective
bottleneck strength of  Q = 704 veh/h/lane caused
by the ramps still allow the PLC to exist, consider-
ing the large perturbation by the MLC. According
to the phase diagram of Figure 16b, the LC should
even be slowly growing. In fact, the the velocity
drops at cross-section S13 at 8:23 a.m. and at cross-
section S12 at 8:48 a.m. At 8:53 a.m., when the con-
gestion reaches cross-section S11 and extends over the
whole junction, we expect a different trafﬁc state (see
§6.7). In fact, moving localized trafﬁc becomes visible,
which triggers an accident at 8:50 a.m. between cross-
sections S12 and S13, namely, at kilometer 479.2. This
results in a bottleneck with an outﬂow of Qhinderedout =
1�431 veh/h/lane, so that the downstream conges-
tion at Intersection Bad Homburg disappears. The
bottleneck strength of the accident location is  Q =
Qout − Qhinderedout = �1�551 − 1�431� veh/h/lane ≈ 120
veh/h/lane, where we have estimated the outﬂow
Qout ≈ 1�551 veh/h/lane by the outﬂow at cross-
section S11 between 9:47 a.m. and 9:56 a.m., i.e., after
the accident was cleared. The upstream ﬂow mea-
sured at cross-section S8 was Qup = 1�816 veh/h/lane,
which is consistent with the observed stop-and-go
waves (see Figure 16b). These cross Junction Fried-
berg at kilometer 471.5, because the ﬂow condi-
tions over there (with Qup = 1�638 veh/h/lane and
 Q = 136 veh/h/lane) allow the survival of MLCs
(see Figure 14). Note that the last MLC dissolved
before it reaches Junction Friedberg, as its outﬂow
Qout ≈ 1�860 veh/h/lane is greater than its inﬂow
Qup ≈ 1�660 veh/h/lane, which is the outﬂow of the
upstream MLC.
Figure 21b displays SGWs upstream of Intersection

Bad Homburg; this congestion pattern is generated at
the uphill gradient shortly downstream of this inter-
section. Around 17:20, homogeneous congested traf-
ﬁc forms at the Intersection Frankfurt North-West as
a result of an accident at kilometer 487.5 at 17:13.
The downstream front of this HCT pattern is pinned
between cross-sections N7 and N8, and the outﬂow
of the accident site is just Qhinderedout = 873 veh/h/lane,
so that we ﬁnd free trafﬁc ﬂow downstream. If we
compare this value with the normal outﬂow of Qout ≈
1700 veh/h/lane in the ﬁrst minutes after the accident
has been cleared, the estimated bottleneck strength
is  Q ≈ 827 veh/h/lane, which is consistent with
the phase diagram (see Figure 15a). After the acci-
dent has been cleared, the downstream congestion
front moves upstream until it reaches the next bottle-
necks at the Intersections Frankfurt North-West and

Frankfurt West. These are less severe due to exist-
ing off-ramps, and cause OCT. At the same time, the
increased outﬂow causes a congestion pattern for 45
minutes at the uphill gradient after Intersection Bad
Homburg, where trafﬁc was already congested before
the accident.

7. Summary, Discussion, and
Conclusions

In this contribution, we critically discussed the argu-
ments in favor of and against ﬁrst- and second-
order trafﬁc models. In particular, we pointed out
that it is possible to formulate a macroscopic traf-
ﬁc model with a dynamical velocity equation that
is theoretically consistent—i.e., overcomes the criti-
cisms raised in Daganzo’s Requiem (Daganzo 1995b)
and other publications. Such a model is the nonlocal
GKT model (Treiber, Hennecke, and Helbing 1999),
which implies the existence of several different kinds
of congested trafﬁc states. The conditions for the pos-
sible occurrence of these states have been illustrated
by a phase diagram as a function of the bottleneck
strength and the upstream trafﬁc ﬂow. One impor-
tant point of this phase diagram is the multistable
nature of trafﬁc ﬂows. That is, several different traf-
ﬁc states can exist under similar conditions. Their
occurrence depends on the initial and boundary con-
ditions, particularly on whether there occurs a large
perturbation or not (compare Figures 4a and 4b). Sim-
ilar predictions have been made by microscopic trafﬁc
models with stable, metastable, and linearly unsta-
ble trafﬁc regimes (Treiber, Hennecke, and Helbing
2000; Helbing et al. 2002). However, a trafﬁc model
without linearly unstable ﬂow regimes, but stable and
metastable density regimes only, would imply the
same congestion patterns.12 Furthermore, the validity
of the phase diagram is not restricted to a particular
trafﬁc model. The phase diagram approach can also
be used without linking it to any model.
In order to test the predictions of the LWR model

and the phase diagram, and in order to assess
Kerner’s ﬁndings, we have carried out an extensive
study of empirical trafﬁc states observed at a 30-
kilometer-long section of the German freeway A5
near Frankfurt. Despite two freeway intersections,
there were approximately 10-kilometer-long freeway
sections without any on- or off-ramps. To obtain a
more detailed picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics
of trafﬁc ﬂows, we have used an adaptive smoothing
algorithm that interpolates and smooths trafﬁc data
from successive cross-sections of the freeway, taking

for  Q <Qout −Qc3. According to Figure 15b, this would be com-
patible with Qout −Qc3 ≈ 400 veh/h/lane.

into account the propagation speeds of perturbations
in free and congested trafﬁc. The method is based on
measurements of average vehicle speeds by double-
loop detectors, which are quite reliable. Our inverted
speed representation is reminiscent of density plots,
which are easy to interpret.
Along the freeway section we studied, we have

found a rich variety of congested trafﬁc states, but the
great majority of them could, in fact, be interpreted
as a spatial combination of, altogether, six different,
elementary trafﬁc states: free trafﬁc (FT), pinned local-
ized clusters (PLC), moving localized clusters (MLC),
stop-and-go waves (SGW), oscillating congested traf-
ﬁc (OCT), and homogeneous congested trafﬁc (HCT);
see §§6.1 to 6.5. The same states have been found at
other freeways that we studied (Treiber, Hennecke,
and Helbing 2000; Helbing et al. 2002). A detailed
understanding of complex trafﬁc patterns consisting
of several elementary congestion states is made pos-
sible by considering combinations of several bottle-
necks, such as on- and off-ramps (see §§6.7 to 6.9).

7.1. Facing Kerner’s Criticisms
Because Kerner has generally criticized all models
with a fundamental diagram (i.e., most trafﬁc models
ever developed in the history of trafﬁc science), and
because he has speciﬁcally questioned some features
of the GKT model, let us address these points in the
following:
1. According to Kerner (1998b), models containing

a fundamental diagram could not explain the wide
scattering of ﬂow-density data observed for synchro-
nized congested trafﬁc ﬂow.
2. The phase diagram approach would predict the

transitions free trafﬁc → moving or pinned localized
cluster → stop-and-go trafﬁc or oscillating congested
trafﬁc → homogeneous congested trafﬁc as the ramp
ﬂow or the overall trafﬁc volume Qtot increases. How-
ever, homogeneous congested trafﬁc would not exist
(Kerner 2002a, b), and the actual transition to moving
jams would always require an advance transition to
synchronized ﬂow.
Let us comment on these points one by one in the

same order:
1. Kerner’s criticism is based on a comparison of

his empirical data (usually one-minute aggregates)
with simulation results that do not simulate the mea-
surement (aggregation) process and do not contain
effects of different vehicle classes, different driver
behaviors, and lane changes. However, it has been
shown that all three aspects produce a scattering of
ﬂow-density data in the congested regime (Treiber
and Helbing 1999; Nishinari, Treiber, and Helbing
2003). Quite realistic ﬂuctuations of “synchronized”
congested ﬂow can already be obtained by simulat-
ing a mixture of two vehicle classes, each obeying

a macroscopic trafﬁc model with a fundamental dia-
gram (Treiber and Helbing 1999). Moreover, it has
been found that the wide scattering of ﬂow-density
data in synchronized congestion states can be very
well reproduced by the formula

Q�t�= 1

for the jam line (Kerner and Konhäuser 1994b; Kerner
and Rehborn 1996b) if not only the vehicle density
��t� is varied in time, but also the time gap T �t�
and the jam density �max�t� (Nishinari, Treiber, and
Helbing 2003), as demanded by Banks (1999). These
vary naturally due to ﬂuctuating truck fractions and
driver behaviors (Treiber and Helbing 1999).
2. HCT clearly exists (see Figure 10), but it occurs

very rarely and only for extremely large bottle-
neck strengths exceeding  Q ≈ 700 vehicles/h/lane.
Because freeways are dimensioned in a way to avoid
bottlenecks of this size, HCT occurs primarily when
freeway lanes are closed after a serious accident. In
other words, when excluding cases of accidents from
the data set, HCT states will normally not be found.
Moreover, Kerner is wrong in claiming that our the-
oretical phase diagram would require MLCs to occur
before the transition to SGWs or OCT. This misunder-
standing might have occurred by ignoring the depen-
dence of the trafﬁc state predicted by the theoreti-
cal phase diagram on the perturbation size. Figure 4a
clearly shows that a direct transition from FT ﬂow to
OCT is predicted in cases of small perturbations.
In summary, according to our analysis, Kerner has

rejected other theories for wrong reasons, namely
because alternative explanations of empirical facts
(and the data themselves) were not checked care-
fully enough. Therefore, we currently do not see any
reasons to replace well-justiﬁed macroscopic trafﬁc
models such as the nonlocal GKT model by more
complicated models trying to explain the same facts
with a higher number of parameters.

7.2. Criticism of the Three-Phase Theory and Its
Extensions

7.2.1. Three-Phase Theory and “Moving Syn-
chronized Patterns.” Kerner’s three phase-theory is
a well-known attempt at a systematic classiﬁcation of
different trafﬁc states (Kerner and Rehborn 1996b).
This classiﬁcation is phenomenological and distin-
guishes free trafﬁc, synchronized ﬂow, and wide
moving jams (Kerner et al. 2004). In contrast to
synchronized ﬂow, wide moving jams are local-
ized. They have a characteristic outﬂow and a con-
stant downstream propagation speed (Kerner and
Rehborn 1996a). Synchronized ﬂow has further been
subdivided into three different kinds (Kerner and

Rehborn 1996b): (i) stationary and homogeneous states,
where both the average speed and the ﬂow rate
are stationary during a relatively long time inter-
val, (ii) “homogeneous-in-speed states,” see also Kerner
(1998b), and (iii) nonstationary and nonhomogeneous
states, see also Kerner (1998b).
Comparing Kerner’s classiﬁcation with ours, homo-

geneous congested trafﬁc (HCT) may correspond
to “synchronized” trafﬁc ﬂow of type (i), whereas
oscillating congested trafﬁc (OCT) seems to relate
to synchronized ﬂow of type (iii). Moreover, homo-
geneous-in-speed states resemble the free branch of
the fundamental diagram, but with a reduced free
velocity. Therefore, this synchronized ﬂow of type
(ii) bears features of both free and congested traf-
ﬁc. This may reﬂect the inﬂuence of the “intelli-
gent speed control” operated at the studied freeway
stretch, or it may point to recovering trafﬁc down-
stream of bottlenecks (see Treiber and Helbing 1999,
Figure 4; Tilch and Helbing 2000, Figure 3). Finally,
Kerner’s wide moving jams seem to be comparable
to moving localized clusters (MLC). A major techni-
cal difference between the classiﬁcation of Kerner and
ourselves seems to be that our classiﬁcation is based
on an analysis of the spatiotemporal trafﬁc dynam-
ics, while Kerner’s is based on the dynamics at single
freeway cross-sections or comparisons of the dynam-
ics at subsequent sections. Moreover, our phase dia-
gram deﬁnes quantitative existence criteria, whereas
the three-phase theory stays qualitative.
Although Kerner claims that the three-phase the-

ory is the only theory that can describe the empirical
phenomena accurately, he keeps reporting new spa-
tiotemporal trafﬁc patterns. The general pattern and
the pinch effect will be critically discussed in the next
section. Recently, Kerner has introduced the notion
of a “moving synchronized pattern” (MSP) to resolve
inconsistencies with his three-phase theory. The rea-
son for this is Kerner’s microsimulation of localized
moving jam structures that are stopping at a bottle-
neck, as we have discovered them in our empirical
data (see Figures 9b, 20a, and 21a). These localized
patterns can obviously not be called wide moving
jams, because these should propagate through all traf-
ﬁc states.
MSPs travel with the same speed as wide moving

jams, however, “� � � in contrast with a wide moving
jam, if a MSP reaches a bottleneck, the MSP is caught
at the bottleneck: The MSP that propagates upstream
can exist only for a ﬁnite time” (Kerner 2005, p. 187).
That is, the actual type of trafﬁc congestion remains
undeﬁned until it reaches the next upstream bottle-
neck. It is certainly not scientiﬁc to distinguish two
apparently identical states that cannot be told apart,
at least if there is no upstream bottleneck at all. Even
if there is a bottleneck allowing one to differentiate



Schönhof and Helbing: Empirical Features of Congested Trafﬁc States
162 Transportation Science 41(2), pp. 135–166, © 2007 INFORMS

between an MSP and a wide moving jam, the “catch-
ing” of the jam and thus the identity of the trafﬁc
phenomenon will depend on the bottleneck strength,
which leaves the classiﬁcation unsatisfactory. Thus,
a clear identiﬁcation of a wide moving jam in con-
trast to synchronized trafﬁc is no longer possible, and
the three-phase theory is severely questioned by this
shortcoming.

7.2.2. Criticism of the Pinch Effect and Gener-
alized Pattern Generating Wide Moving Jams. In
his three-phase theory, Kerner also states that the
occurrence of wide moving jams would necessarily
require the previous transition from free to synchro-
nized ﬂow (Kerner 1998b; 2000a, b) and that the gen-
eration mechanism could be imagined as follows: In
the “general pattern,” synchronized trafﬁc upstream
of a bottleneck would breed wide moving jams based
on the pinch effect. That is, upstream of a section with
synchronized congested trafﬁc close to a bottleneck,
a so-called pinch region should spontaneously give
birth to narrow vehicle clusters. These perturbations
should be growing while travelling further upstream.
Eventually, wide moving jams should be formed by
the merging or disappearance of narrow jams. Once
formed, wide jams should suppress the occurrence of
new narrow jams in between. Instead of forming wide
jams, however, narrow jams would be able to coexist
if their distance was larger than about 2.5 km (Kerner
1998a).
In our empirical analysis, we have found only a few

examples of Kerner’s pinch effect, i.e., for the merging
or dissolution of small narrow jams (see Figure 20).
This may be a consequence of averaging out small
perturbations by the adaptive smoothing method, but
we think that such small perturbations are subject
to interpretation and should not constitute the basis
of a theory. We did, however, ﬁnd congestion pat-
terns resembling Kerner’s general pattern. However,
we do not interpret them as congestion patterns that
would generally occur at an isolated bottleneck far
away from other bottlenecks or inhomogeneities, as
Kerner (2002b) suggests. Kerner (2002b, p. 9) claims
that “the effective bottleneck at D6 can indeed be con-
sidered as an isolated bottleneck at the on ramp.” We
doubt this. According to our analysis, a general pat-
tern instead occurs because of the complex interaction
between different on- and off-ramps (and, addition-
ally, with long ramp lanes). In particular, we interpret
a general pattern as a combination of an extended
form of congested trafﬁc between an off-ramp and
a subsequent on-ramp, with SGWs upstream of the
off-ramp, which must be treated as a second, weaker
bottleneck (see §6.7). In our data, the pinch effect
and general patterns did not clearly occur at ﬂow-
conserving bottlenecks such as gradients or locations

of accidents, although some simulation models indi-
cate the possibility of this (Helbing et al. 2002).
Moreover, we point out that the SGW and wide

moving jams (MLC states) depicted in Figures 12
and 13 are clearly not emanating from synchronized
ﬂows or general patterns. We have instead identiﬁed
two other mechanisms that generate moving localized
clusters:
1. SGWs like the ones depicted in Figure 12 and

single MLCs, as shown in Figure 13a seem to appear
spontaneously at a gradient due to unstable trafﬁc
ﬂows.
2. The MLC patterns in Figures 9b, 13b, 20b, and

21a have been initiated by the boomerang effect,
which is based on a signiﬁcant downstream travelling
perturbation. The boomerang effect was the origin of
at least 18 out of 245 cases of trafﬁc breakdowns.

7.3. Conclusions
Applying the adaptive smoothing method, which can
visualize small perturbations and distinguish them
from ﬂuctuations by avoiding that continuously mov-
ing patterns are split up into artiﬁcial, discontinu-
ously looking structures (see Figure 8), we obtained
a more detailed picture of the spatiotemporal dynam-
ics of trafﬁc ﬂows. We identiﬁed growing perturba-
tions on freeway stretches without ramps or changes
in the number of lanes. This questions the validity of
the LWR model and supports trafﬁc models with an
unstable trafﬁc regime. The LWR model also does not
provide a good explanation for the different observed
congestion states.
We have shown that the typical trafﬁc pattern

depends on the upstream freeway ﬂow Qup and the
bottleneck strength  Q.13 Therefore, the frequency of
different trafﬁc patterns also depends on the weekday
(see Figure 22). However, there is usually no unique
relationship between the ﬂow values � Q�Qup� and
the type of congestion (see Figure 15b). Due to multi-
stability, initial and boundary conditions are also
relevant (see Figure 4). Therefore, many trafﬁc break-
downs are triggered by perturbations in the traf-
ﬁc ﬂow, e.g., overtaking maneuvers of trucks (see
Figure 2b).
In our study, less than 5% of the congested traf-

ﬁc states remained unexplained, considering the bot-
tlenecks along the freeway known to us.14 However,
most of them could be related to accidents based

13 The bottlenecks that we identiﬁed along the freeway were related
to freeway on- or off-ramps, gradients, accidents, or reductions in
the number of lanes. However, they could have other origins as
well, like speed limits or road work, accidents in the opposite lanes
(“rubberneck effect”), bad road conditions (possibly due to rain,
fog, or ice), bad visibility (e.g., because of blinding sun or tunnel
entrances), distracting views, or curves.
14 Note that we did not have a protocol of road works performed.

Figure 22 Absolute Frequencies of Congested Trafﬁc States on the German Freeway A5 Close to Frankfurt (a) in Direction North and (b) in Direction
South

Notes. One can see a typical dependence of the absolute frequency of congestion and the relative frequency of different kinds of congestion on weekdays. On
Saturdays and Sundays, congestion occurred less frequently compared to work days, as expected. Moreover, in direction North, congestion patterns appeared
rarely on Mondays compared to Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays, while in direction South, the frequency of trafﬁc breakdowns was surprisingly low on
Fridays. This could be explained by commuters spending their weekends in the North and living in Frankfurt during the week.

on police reports, or they were cases of forwardly
moving “phantom” bottlenecks (Gazis and Herman
1992; Muñoz and Daganzo 2002b), among them two
congestion patterns moving forward at speeds of 1.6
km/h and 2.7 km/h (not shown). The most frequent
states at the investigated freeway section were PLC
and OCT states (see Figure 22), while large HCT states
occurred mainly after serious accidents with lane clo-
sures.15 The downstream fronts of these congestion
patterns were located at bottlenecks, while for MLC
and SGW states, they mostly propagated upstream at
a constant speed c0 ≈−16±2 km/h. However, we also
found changes in the propagation speed that seem to
depend on the gradient (see Figure 20b).
The explanation of complex congestion patterns

requires us to consider the combination of several bot-
tlenecks. For example, on-ramp bottlenecks are fre-
quently combined with a closeby upstream off-ramp.
In such cases, the upstream front of extended forms of
congested trafﬁc (such as HCT or OCT) is often ﬁxed
at the location of the off-ramp (Treiber, Hennecke,
and Helbing 2000; Lee, Lee, and Kim 2000). More-
over, the congestion type typically changes to a milder
form upstream, for example, SGWs. Then, the overall
appearance resembles of the pinch effect or general
pattern (Kerner 1998a, 2002b). However, SGWs may
also be generated by the boomerang effect or appear
spontaneously at a bottleneck (see Figures 9b, 12, 13,
20b, and 21a.) in contrast to Kerner’s three phase the-
ory (Kerner et al. 1998a).
In summary, we have found that the congestion

patterns observed along a section of the freeway A5

close to Frankfurt/Main, Germany, were very con-
sistent with the predictions of the phase diagram of
trafﬁc states. This phase diagram was motivated by
properties of the nonlocal GKT model, which we have
shown to avoid the inconsistencies of second-order
trafﬁc models (see §4), and which qualitatively agrees
with phase diagrams obtained for a wide class of car-
following models. Moreover, we did not ﬁnd Kerner’s
criticism of models with a fundamental diagram and
the GKT model convincing. Therefore, it is not nec-
essary to discard all previous knowledge accumu-
lated in trafﬁc modeling as suggested by Kerner. The
phase diagram of trafﬁc states instead offers a sim-
ple, straightforward, and consistent explanation of a
wide range of empirical observations in the tradition
of classical trafﬁc ﬂow modeling.
