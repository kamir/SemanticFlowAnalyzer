In this paper, we report empirical investigation of traffic

congestion in a highway section containing one effective on-
ramp. Details of the section are given in our preliminary
report @13#, so we provide here only a brief description ~Fig.
1!. All ramps are connected to the outermost lane ~lane 4!
and a stretch of lane divider ~from x53.5 to 8.3 km, dashed
line in Fig. 1! blocks lane change from the two outer lanes
~lane 3 and 4! to the two inner ones ~lane 1 and 2! and vice
versa. In a short road segment near the end of the lane di-
vider ~from x58.3 km to the location of the detector D9
approximately!, many vehicles in the outer lanes switch into
the inner lanes, which is also enhanced by vehicle flux
through the on-ramp ON3 at x58.6 km. As a result, this
segment works as an effective on-ramp region for the traffic
flow of the inner lanes and traffic congestion often occurs in

In the last decade, there has been growing interest in the
traffic flow, which is partly motivated by the fact that the
traffic flow is an easily perceivable realization of heavily
studied driven nonequilibrium systems @1#. Another impor-
tant motivation is the hope that complex traffic behaviors
may be understood with the help of physical approaches.
Such understanding can be used to optimize traffic and even
to forecast traffic situations.

A reasonable first step along this line of thinking will be
the classification of distinct traffic states and separate inves-
tigation of their properties. Various traffic models are pro-
posed @2# and compared with real traffic data @3#. With the
help of these models, free flow and so-called wide traffic
jams are well understood. On the other hand, the nature of
congested traffic flow ~or synchronized flow!, which appears
near road inhomogeneities mostly, yet remains unclear de-
spite various empirical @4–6# and theoretical @7–11# efforts.

A recent theoretical study @9# proposed an intriguing pos-
sibility that the congested traffic flow may not be a single
dynamic phase but rather a collection of multiple phases,
each of which is realized under different conditions. A simi-
lar conclusion is also reported from the investigation of an-
other theoretical model @10#. In the empirical investigations,
however, although qualitatively distinct congested traffic
states are reported @4,12#, no empirical evidence is found for
the existence of any characteristic parameters that distinguish

the road section with the lane divider, where the inner lanes
are decoupled from the outer ones.

We investigate the traffic congestion in the inner lanes
using the 30 s averaged traffic data from June to September,
1999 ~a total of 107 days, a much larger data set compared to
14 days in Ref. @13#!. All quantities below are averaged over
the two inner lanes. For each realization of a particular con-
gested traffic state, which is stably maintained about 30 min
or longer, the effective ramp flux f rmp @defined as the differ-
ence between two flux values measured at the detectors D10
and D7, q(D10)2q(D7)# and the upstream flux f up @q(Dn)
is used when the congestion extends up to Dn11# are aver-
aged over the time interval of its duration and the resulting
average values ^ f rmp&, ^ f up& are marked in Fig. 2~a!. Note
that three congested traffic states, which we call CT2, CT4,
and CT5 states, respectively ~see below!, occupy distinct re-
gions, providing a supporting evidence for the prediction
@9,10# that f up and f rmp are characteristic parameters of con-
gested traffic flow. Thus Fig. 2~a! becomes an empirical
phase diagram of the congested traffic flow. Figure 2~b!
shows an alternative phase diagram obtained from 10 min
averaging of the flux values instead. Two phase diagrams are
qualitatively the same.

previously reported @6# that the congested region may consist
of backward ~towards upstream! traveling clusters and the
size of the clusters grow spontaneously during their back-
ward propagation. As a result, large amplitude oscillation of
velocity develops spontaneously. On the other hand, recent
theories @9,10# predict that large velocity oscillation may or
may not develop. Thus our criterion ~i! is whether such spon-
taneous growth of velocity oscillation appears ~CT5! or not
~CT2, CT4!. This criterion can be examined by comparing
temporal variation of velocity at different detectors.

In the same theoretical works, both expanding and nonex-
panding traffic states are predicted, and our criterion ~ii! is
whether the congested region expands monotonically ~CT4,
CT5! or not ~CT2!. Mathematically the expansion rate of the
congested region is proportional to the degree of flux mis-
match f up1 f rmp2 f down , where f down measures the outflow

from the congested region @q(D10) is used#. Thus the com-
parison of ^ f up&1^ f rmp& and ^ f down& can be used as a more
objective application of the criterion ~ii!.
In all three states, the density-flow relations show fluctu-

ating behavior @such as Fig. 2~c! in Ref. @4## and the velocity
variations in the lane 1 and 2 are synchronized ~such as Fig.
2 in Ref. @5#!. Since these properties are already reported in
other publications, we do not present similar figures here.
Below we discuss other properties of the congested traffic
states.

Figure 3~a! depicts the density profile r(x ,t) of the CT2
state and its evolution with time, where r(x ,t) is evaluated
by q(x ,t)/u(x ,t) and u(x ,t) is the harmonic mean velocity
@14# over 30 s intervals. The spontaneous growth of the ve-
locity oscillation mentioned in the criterion ~i! does not ap-
pear. The flux mismatch ^ f rmp&1^ f up&2^ f down& is negligible
and the congested region does not expand. Empirical data
also show that the length of the congested region increases
with ^ f rmp& and its dependence on ^ f up& is rather weak @15#.

Figure 3~b! shows the CT4 state. The spontaneous growth
of the velocity oscillation does not appear. Due to the large
flux mismatch ~typical value of ^ f up&1^ f rmp&2^ f down& is
500–600 vehicles/h!, the congested region expands with
time. The expansion rate ranges from 3 to 9 km/h and in-
creases with increasing flux mismatch. An interesting prop-
erty is that the outflow ^ f down& is practically independent of
^ f up& and ^ f up&, and remains almost universal. The average
of ^ f down& over the 28 realizations of the CT4 state in Fig.
2~a! is 2010 vehicles/h and its standard deviation is about 65
vehicles/h, which is much smaller than the spread of ^ f up&
and ^ f rmp&. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical in-
dication of the universal outflow from the congested flow
near an on-ramp @16#.

Figure 3~c! portrays the CT5 state. An important feature
of the CT5 state is the spontaneous growth of the velocity
oscillation inside the congested region. Figure 4 shows the
temporal variation of the velocity at D5 and D6. The graph
for D6 is shifted to the right by 5 min for comparison. Note
that the velocity evolutions at the two detectors are corre-
lated after the time shift for D6, and that the velocity oscil-
lates with larger amplitude at D5. These features imply that
velocity wave propagates backward ~towards upstream! and
its amplitude grows during its propagation.

Regarding the criterion ~ii!, the congested region expands
as shown in Fig. 3~c!. The upstream front of the congested
region initially locates between D5 and D6 and later between
D4 and D5. We mention that the flux at D4 remains quasi-
stationary during the depicted time interval. Thus the expan-
sion is not due to the increase of f up but due to the flux
mismatch. Compared to the CT4 state, however, it turns out
that the flux mismatch ~typically 200–250 vehicles/h! is con-
siderably smaller, which implies a slower expansion of the
congested region. We estimate the expansion rate by the flux
mismatch divided by the density difference at the upstream
front of the congested region, and find it ranges 2–4 km/h
@17#. The outflow of this state is not universal.

It is interesting to compare empirically identified states
with theoretically predicted states @7–10#. Application of the
criteria ~i,ii! to both empirical and theoretical states leads to
the following pairing between empirical and theoretical

states: the CT2 state with the theoretically predicted pinned
localized cluster ~PLC! state, the CT4 state with the homo-



E
geneous congested traffic ~HCT! state, and the CT5 state
with the oscillating congested traffic ~OCT! state.

The pairing motivates further comparison between the
paired states. For the CT4-HCT pair, we note that the uni-
versal outflow is predicted for the HCT state @9# and the
same property is observed for the CT4 state, which strongly

~b!, and CT5 state ~c!.

PRE 62 PHASE DIAGRAM OF CONG
motivates the identification of the CT4 state with the HCT
states. For the CT5-OCT pair, on other hand, while the out-
flow is universal for the OCT state @9#, it is not for the CT5
state. Thus properties of these two states are only in partial
agreement. And for the CT2-PLC pair, we find one quanti-
tative difference: the congested region of the CT2 state is
considerably wider than that of the PLC state in Refs. @9# and
@10#. The resolution of this discrepancy may require im-
proved traffic theories.

We also compare the theoretical and empirical phase dia-
grams. It is predicted in Ref. @9# that when the upstream flux
and the ramp flux are maintained at strictly constant values,
f up and f rmp , respectively, the phase boundary between the
flux matching and flux mismatching states is practically
identical to the stability boundary of the free flow, below
which the free flow can remain linearly stable, and given by
the line f up1a f rmp5Q˜ out , where a51 and Q˜ out is a con-
stant whose value is almost identical to the universal outflow
of the HCT state (a is predicted to be a little larger than 1 in
Ref. @10#!.

Empirical determination of the free flow stability bound-
ary is not an easy task since the free flow near the boundary
is quite vulnerable to fluctuations. In the empirical phase
diagram @Fig. 2~a!#, the dashed line (^ f up&1a^ f rmp&5Q˜ out ,
where a’1.3 and Q˜ out’2100 vehicles/h) is an empirical
estimation of the stability boundary. Here the values of a
and Q˜ out are reliable up to their first significant digits and
their second significant digits are rather uncertain. Within
this accuracy, a is approximately one and the value of Q˜ out
is close to the universal outflow of the CT4 state. It is also
pleasing to note that this line divides ~except for a small
number of data points! the flux matching and mismatching
states, in agreement with the theoretical prediction @9#. This
feature is robust and independent of details of the boundary
estimation method although the values of a and Q˜ out depend
on the details. We also note that in a later, more refined
theory @12#, it is predicted that the PLC and OCT states
overlap weakly in the phase diagram. Recalling the pairing
CT2-PLC and CT5-OCT, the weak overlap of the CT2 and
CT5 states in Fig. 2~a! is in agreement with this prediction.
Also the locations of the empirical and theoretical overlap
regions in the phase diagram are similar.

Regarding the phase boundary between the two expand-
ing traffic states ~CT4, CT5!, while the recent theory @9#

congested region of the CT5 state. The velocity evolution at D6 is
shifted to the right by 5 min for clear comparison.

predicts the line f rmp5const as the phase boundary between
the HCT and OCT states, Fig. 2~a! shows that the boundary



L
between the CT4 and CT5 states is better described by
^ f up&5const. Thus as for the phase boundary between the
expanding states, empirical results and the theoretical predic-
tion do not agree.

We next discuss an implicit but important conceptual im-
plication of the recent theories @7–10#, where traffic phases
are identified with resulting final states that traffic flow dy-
namics lead to after sufficient transient time. In the language
of nonlinear dynamics, all these states correspond to stable
attractors @18# of traffic flow dynamics. An implication of
this concept is that for a given external condition ~such as
f rmp , f up , and ramp geometry!, the resulting traffic state is
independent of details of the initial traffic state or its ‘‘evo-
lution history’’ @19#.

This idea can be tested empirically, for example, by com-
paring realizations with the same external conditions but
with different evolution histories. Figure 5 compares the
~time-averaged! velocity profile of two realizations of the
CT2 state, both with almost the same ^ f rmp& and ^ f up&. But
their evolution histories are different: one has evolved from
the free flow and the other from the CT5 state ~inset in Fig.
5!. Note that two profiles almost overlap with each other
despite qualitatively different evolution histories. This insen-
sitivity to the evolution history confirms the conceptual im-
plication of the recent theoretical works.

Obviously there is a fundamental difference between the-
oretical and empirical situations: while theories @7–10# as-
sume strictly constant upstream and ramp fluxes, in real traf-
fic the fluxes fluctuate all the time. Thus in order to make a
rigorous comparison with theories, a good understanding of
fluctuation effects is necessary. However such an under-
standing is not available at present, so in this paper, the fluc-
tuation effects are essentially ignored and the time-averaged
values ^ f rmp& and ^ f up& are instead used in the analysis.
Hence in a strict sense, the present investigation is only a
correlation analysis between the time-averaged flux values
and the traffic states that are maintained for a sufficiently

the CT2 state with almost identical ^ f up& and ^ f rmp& but with differ-
ent evolution histories ~solid line for the realization 1 and dashed

oped from the CT5 state via a phase transition, the realization 2 has

long time. In retrospect, however, it turns out that many em-
pirical results can be explained by the theories if one accepts
that ^ f rmp& and ^ f up& play the roles of the constant ramp flux
and upstream flux, respectively, assumed in the theories.
Hence it appears that the neglect of the fluctuation effects
can be justified at least a posteriori.

Its justification can be partly understood from two argu-
ments: first, while the fluctuation effects are usually crucial
near the phase boundary, traffic states far from the phase
boundary are relatively insensitive to fluctuations. Thus
when a traffic state occupies a sufficiently wide region in the
phase diagram, the use of the time-averaged flux values for
the phase diagram can be justified. Second, dominant contri-
butions to flux fluctuations come from short-time scale of
order 1 min, and in the time scale of about 10 min or longer,
flux variation is almost quasistationary. Thus, provided that
the relevant time scale of a traffic state ~not very close to the
phase boundary! is longer than 1 min, the short-time scale
fluctuations will be effectively averaged out by the traffic
dynamics itself and can be neglected indeed.

In support of these arguments, we find that our results are
not sensitive to the length of the averaging time interval as
long as it is sufficiently longer than 1 min. When the same
analysis is repeated with 10 min averaging, Fig. 2~b! is ob-
tained. Note that this new phase diagram is qualitatively the
same as the former one @Fig. 2~a!# and all discussions above
remain unchanged. Changes occur only in a quantitative
level. With the 10 min averaging, the standard deviation of
the outflow ^ f down& from the CT4 state increases to about 85
vehicles/h.

We remark on a few details of the analysis. First, there
exists another on-ramp ~ON4! at 2.3 km downstream from
ON3. Sometimes vehicle flux through this on-ramp causes
traffic congestion and the resulting congestion extends to the
region studied in this paper. All such events are excluded
from the present analysis to focus on one particular inhomo-
geneity @20#. Second, in the analyzed road section, there are
two spots ~one between D5 and D6 and the other near D7!,
where the lane divider is imperfect. All time intervals with
non-negligible vehicle fluxes through those spots are not in-
cluded in the analysis.

In summary, three congested traffic states are identified
based on local velocity variation patterns and expansion ~or
nonexpansion! of the congested region. It is found that the
appearance of these congested traffic states is strongly cor-
related with the time-averaged flux values, ^ f up& and ^ f rmp&,
providing a strong supporting evidence to the prediction
@9,10# that these flux values are characteristic parameters of
the congested traffic flow. An empirical phase diagram is
constructed and compared with theoretical predictions. The
prediction on the phase boundary between the flux matching
and mismatching states is consistent with the empirical phase
diagram and the prediction of the universal outflow are con-
firmed. However some deviations from theoretical predic-
tions are also found. Finally we mention that there exist re-
gions in the ^ f rmp&2^ f up& plane that are not probed. Thus it
is possible that additional congested traffic states exist in
those regions.

dependence of the congested region size on ^ f rmp&, the bound-
ary will locate at a particular detector when ^ f rmp& is close to a
certain special value. In such a case, small fluctuations of the
boundary can cause large amplitude fluctuations of velocity at
that special detector since the velocity varies greatly across the
boundary. Such large velocity fluctuations are indeed observed
in narrow ranges of ^ f rmp& ~for example, at D6 when ^ f rmp&
5330630 vehicles/h). We remark that these fluctuations
should be distinguished from the velocity oscillations @6# in the
criterion ~i!. While the former originates from the boundary
fluctuations and is localized near the boundary, the latter grows
continuously inside the congested region and is extended over
relatively wide congested region.

@16# At 30 s scale, f down @q(D10)# fluctuates within the

61.2 vehicles/30 s is quite a small number considering that
the vehicle number counting by detectors always results
in integer numbers and thus the inaccuracy of
